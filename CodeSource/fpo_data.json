In this manner, fatigue inducing and\/or structurally damaging unsteady aerodynamic forces experienced upon the blade and\/or fan disc during operation are controlled, and the resultant fluctuating fan blade and disc peak stresses are mitigated.","Inventor Name":"MILLS ROBERT (US); HENNE PRESTON (US); JOHANN ERIK (DE)","Assignee":"ROLLS ROYCE DEUTSCHLAND (DE)","Filing Date":"2004-12-20"},{"Document Number":"JP2019528213A","Document Type":"JP","Publication Date":"2019-10-10","Title":"\u4e8c\u91cd\u5727\u7e2e\u6a5f\uff14\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u74b0\u5883\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u6539\u5584\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4e88\u51b7\u65b9\u6cd5\u304a\u3088\u3073\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f","Abstract":"\u30ac\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\uff08\uff11\uff12\uff09\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u62bd\u6c17\u3092\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306e\u74b0\u5883\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff08\uff14\uff18\uff09\u306b\u4f9b\u7d66\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304a\u3088\u3073\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306f\u3001\u74b0\u5883\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff08\uff14\uff18\uff09\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u62bd\u6c17\u9700\u8981\u3092\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3068\u3001\u4f4e\u5727\u304a\u3088\u3073\u9ad8\u5727\u62bd\u6c17\uff08\uff16\uff16\u3001\uff16\uff16\uff41\u3001\uff16\uff16\uff42\u3001\uff16\uff18\uff09\u3092\u9078\u629e\u7684\u306b\u74b0\u5883\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff08\uff14\uff18\uff09\u306b\u4f9b\u7d66\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3068\u3092\u542b\u307f\u3001\u9078\u629e\u7684\u4f9b\u7d66\u306f\u3001\u8abf\u6574\u7a7a\u6c17\u6d41\u304c\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u62bd\u6c17\u9700\u8981\u3092\u6e80\u305f\u3059\u3088\u3046\u306b\u5236\u5fa1\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u3010\u9078\u629e\u56f3\u3011\u56f3\uff13","Inventor Name":"Astron, Dominique Patrick","Assignee":"GE Aviation Systems LLC","Filing Date":"2017-08-23"},{"Document Number":"JP2019528212A","Document Type":"JP","Publication Date":"2019-10-10","Title":"\uff13\u30db\u30a4\u30fc\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u3092\u7528\u3044\u305f\u74b0\u5883\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u6539\u5584\u3055\u308c\u305f\u4e88\u51b7\u65b9\u6cd5\u304a\u3088\u3073\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f","Abstract":"\u30ac\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d3\u30f3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3\uff08\uff11\uff12\uff09\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u3066\u62bd\u6c17\u3092\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\uff08\uff11\uff10\uff09\u306e\u74b0\u5883\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff08\uff14\uff18\uff09\u306b\u4f9b\u7d66\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304a\u3088\u3073\u822a\u7a7a\u6a5f\u306f\u3001\u74b0\u5883\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff08\uff14\uff18\uff09\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u62bd\u6c17\u9700\u8981\u3092\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3068\u3001\u4f4e\u5727\u304a\u3088\u3073\u9ad8\u5727\u62bd\u6c17\uff08\uff16\uff16\u3001\uff16\uff18\uff09\u3092\u9078\u629e\u7684\u306b\u74b0\u5883\u5236\u5fa1\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\uff08\uff14\uff18\uff09\u4f9b\u7d66\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3068\u3092\u542b\u307f\u3001\u9078\u629e\u7684\u4f9b\u7d66\u306f\u3001\u8abf\u6574\u7a7a\u6c17\u6d41\u304c\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u62bd\u6c17\u9700\u8981\u3092\u6e80\u305f\u3059\u3088\u3046\u306b\u5236\u5fa1\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u3010\u9078\u629e\u56f3\u3011\u56f3\uff16","Inventor Name":"Astron, Dominique Patrick","Assignee":"GE Aviation Systems LLC","Filing Date":"2017-08-01"},{"Document Number":"WO\/2017\/088907A1","Document Type":"WIPO","Publication Date":"2017-06-01","Title":"SOLID STATE DELIVERY SYSTEM","Abstract":"A hydrogen storage system (36) includes a pressure-sealed storage unit defining an interior (58) and having an outlet, an upper manifold and a lower manifold separated by a dividing plane (50) having a set of ports (64), a set of chambers, and a hydrogen storage, wherein at least some hydrogen gas is supplied to the outlet.","Inventor Name":"HALSEY COLIN JOHN (GB); BAILEY MICHAEL DAVID (GB); WILLIAMS ROSS JONATHAN (GB)","Assignee":"GE AVIAT SYSTEMS LTD (GB)","Filing Date":"2015-11-24"},{"Document Number":"EP4015970B1","Document Type":"EP","Publication Date":"2024-04-03","Title":"HEAT PIPE FOR IMPROVED THERMAL PERFORMANCE AT COLD PLATE INTERFACE","Abstract":"Disclosed embodiments are relate to heat transfer devices or heat exchangers for computing systems, and in particular, to heat pipes for improved thermal performance at a cold plate interface.

In this switching process, however, the horizontal thrust of the by-pass flow circuit remains undiminished. Furthermore, this propulsion system has no air inlet apertures pointing in the direction of flight, since the intake mouth (5) of the air inlet section (6) is directed towards the tail and draws the operating air for the crossflow fan from the mixing flow of the thrust jet.

Micro anaerobic digesters and methane storage units may be configured in a networked environment with a central controller that monitors remote units.","Inventor Name":"MANN CHRISTOPHER (GB); BENNETT MICHAEL (GB)","Assignee":"MANN CHRISTOPHER (GB); BENNETT MICHAEL (GB)","Filing Date":"2012-12-20"},{"Document Number":"WO\/2010\/076776A2","Document Type":"WIPO","Publication Date":"2010-07-08","Title":"METHOD FOR COMPREHENSIVELY INCREASING AERODYNAMIC AND TRANSPORT CHARACTERISTICS, A WING-IN-GROUND-EFFECT CRAFT FOR CARRYING OUT SAID METHOD (VARIANTS) AND A METHOD FOR REALIZING FLIGHT","Abstract":"The group of inventions relates to aviation and to transport means having (static and dynamic) air discharge, in particular to self-stabilizing wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) craft of types \u0410, \u0412 and \u0421. The following technical results are achieved: increased flight safety and manoeuvring safety, increased load-bearing capacity and flight height in ground effect mode, reduced dimensions, improved take-off and landing characteristics, amphibian characteristics and economic efficiency, increased functionality and a wider range of operational alignments, and greater ease of use and maintenance. The above-mentioned result is achieved by the simultaneous application to the \"flying wing\" or \"composite wing\" design layouts of the methods for generating a system of aerodynamic forces, the structural solutions and the piloting methods conceptually linked therewith which are proposed in the present group of inventions. To ensure full longitudinal stability, the actual character of the dependencies of the lifting force value and position of the foci of the low aspect ratio (LAR) lifting wing of the above-mentioned design layouts on the angle of attack and flight height are changed by creating, in the longitudinal direction, at least two local zones having different conditions for the generation of lifting forces, the moments of which are mutually compensated for relative to the centre of mass. The local zones are created by substituting the basic LAR wing with at least two LAR wings (one front, one rear) which are mounted in tandem, but with a partial covering in the horizontal plane and with the formation of an air duct therebetween. The lower half of a slipstream from an annular screw propeller (ASP) mounted on the leading edge of the rear LAR wing is directed into the air duct. This ensures an air flow over the entire surface of the rear LAR wing and the sucking off of a layer of air over the entire span of the upper surface of the front LAR wing which smoothly adjoins the internal surface of the ASP ring. Therefore, only the lower surface of the front LAR wing interacts with a free approach stream. This substantially increases the distance between the foci in terms of height and angle of attack and makes it easier to obtain inherent longitudinal static and dynamic stability. The low aspect ratio wings and the ASP form a single structural base group which, together with aerodynamic float-type end plates and additional LAR wings mounted on the upper edges of the end plates, forms the propulsive lifting structure of the WIG craft. Furthermore, cavities for static, dynamic and static\/dynamic air cushions are formed under the LAR wing while a region of low air pressure with reduced variation in the longitudinal direction is formed above the entire propulsive lifting structure. Longitudinal balancing and additional controllability are ensured by controlling the front and rear lifting force values by changing the angles of inclination of the flaperons of the LAR wings. Full damping of longitudinal oscillations is ensured with the aid of the automatic control of the front and rear lifting force values, during which the front and rear elevators provided can simultaneously act as angle of attack sensors and as a power drive. By means of the spatial and quantitative configuration of the structural base groups, fuselages, float-type end plates, additional LAR wings, consoles, and stabilizing and steering surfaces, and also the specific structural design thereof, said group of inventions makes it possible to create aircraft having different functional possibilities, in different weight categories. The structural characteristics of the above WIG craft are necessary and sufficient to substantially increase the flight safety with the aid of a method in which, in all of the modes and at all of the heights identified for WIG craft flights, all of the elements and flight stages, including manoeuvres in height, are carried out with a constant pitch angle corresponding to the horizontal position of the fuselage.","Inventor Name":"NOVIKOV-KOPP IVAN (DE)","Assignee":"NOVIKOV-KOPP IVAN (DE)","Filing Date":"2010-01-05"},{"Document Number":"EP2960147A1","Document Type":"EP","Publication Date":"2015-12-30","Title":"WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD","Abstract":"A marine propulsor comprises: a stationary part and a movable part which is movable relative to the stationary part; and a wireless communication system, comprising at least one transmitter which is disposed in the movable part and is configured to transmit an electromagnetic data signal and at least one receiver which is disposed in the stationary part and is configured to receive the electromagnetic data signal.

The uncorrected signal appears at the output of 57 and is filtered at 59 and integrated at 60, the output of which is said to be the desired, corrected signal. This is fed back as shown for subtraction at 58 from the uncorrected signal, the output of 58 thus being the dynamic weight errors signal only. This is in turn fed back on line 63 to correct that portion of the computer 49' which calculates the actual coefficient of lift C\/L, and this is the subject of the main claim. The amount of feedback used is determined by KW and is set to allow for slow changes e.g. due to fuel consumption. The signal W is the weight supported by the wings; during take off this varies rapidly so at this time an alternative filter 59', having a short time constant, is switched in. The switch, 204, is controlled by a lift off detector 26 which responds to the tilt angle #, measured by a gyroscope.

The gliding spacecraft (space plane) comprises a thermally-protected lifting body faired with an elevator, wing panels which can be extended in the transverse plane, gas dynamic members for controlling the orientation and flight path of the space plane, instrumentation for providing controlled descent and landing, as well as aircraft landing gear. The nose fairing of the body is made up of movable thermally-protected panels, namely a bottom panel with a heat-resistant nose cone and (nominally) two top panels. If a reusable propulsion and instrumentation module of a second stage launch vehicle is converted into a space plane, then the panels cover the nozzle (or two nozzles) of the main rocket assembly in the reentry configuration. If the space plane is a reusable module from a space transportation vehicle, then the nose fairing panels cover the docking assembly in the insertion and reentry stages. When a reusable propulsion and instrumentation module is in the launch configuration, the wing panels are tented over the upper part of the body of the space plane, and the displaced top panels of the nose fairing lie compactly on them. The bottom panel of the fairing is also displaced and lies compactly against the underside of the middle part of the body of the space plane. The main technical results of the inventions are an increase in the aerodynamic properties of the two chosen types of space plane in the aircraft portion of flight, and the possibility of creating a series of second stage launch vehicle designs based on standardized reusable propulsion and instrumentation modules, in which the total power of the main rocket assembly can vary greatly.","Inventor Name":"RYABUKHA NIKOLAY NIKOLAYEVICH (RU)","Assignee":"RYABUKHA NIKOLAY NIKOLAYEVICH (RU)","Filing Date":"2012-08-22"},{"Document Number":"DE202022000235U1","Document Type":"DE","Publication Date":"2022-02-11","Title":"Baumaterialien aus Carbonfasern, die aus CO2 hergestellt werden","Abstract":"Carbonfasern, dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass der f\u00fcr die Herstellung der Carbonfasern ben\u00f6tigte Kohlenstoff aus dem CO2stammt, welches aus der Verbrennung von Methan, Ethan, Methanol, Ethanol oder einem anderen h\u00f6herwertigen Alkan oder Alkohol stammt, wobei die Carbonfasern in Verbindung mit mineralischen Werkstoffen ein druckfestes und\/oder zugfestes Bau- und\/oder Konstruktionsmaterial bilden.","Inventor Name":null,"Assignee":"WASCHL BRITTA (DE)","Filing Date":"2022-01-29"},{"Document Number":"WO\/2021\/100058A1","Document Type":"WIPO","Publication Date":"2021-05-27","Title":"TWO STROKE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ROTARY ENGINE WITH ZINDLER CURVE RING GEAR","Abstract":"A two stroke internal combustion rotary engine (30) with Zindler curve eccentric ring gear (8) and method of working of a two stroke internal combustion rotary engine (30) with Zindler curve eccentric ring gear is disclosed.

Controlling burners. COMBUSTION ENG. Inc. 23 Dec., 1968 [26 Dec., 1967], No. 60948\/68. Heading F4T. The presence or absence of a flame between two electrodes 14, 18 is detected by applying a low voltage, alternating carrier signal C to electrode 14, and detecting at the electrode 18, which picks up the signal transmitted by electrode 14, whether the signal is modulated as a result of gas ionization in the flame. As shown, an S.C.R. 56 is triggered only when the carrier signal is modulated, the signal then activating a switch 62, e.g. a reed relay in conjunction with a relay hold capacitor 68, which sends the signal to a readout 64. Upon flame cessation, S.C.R. 56 is non-conducting, switch 62 is deactivated, and an alarm 38 is activated. The alarm may be used automatically to turn off the flame gases. The electrodes may be in the form of aviation spark plugs, Fig. 7 (not shown), such that air circulation in the plugs maintains the electrodes clear of combustion products.","Inventor Name":"WALTON LANDON JUN WILLIAM","Assignee":"COMBUSTION ENG","Filing Date":"1968-12-20"},{"Document Number":"JP2021061243A","Document Type":"JP","Publication Date":"2021-04-15","Title":"ELECTRIC OUTPUT GENERATION SYSTEM AND METHOD","Abstract":"To realize a power system that generates electrical and thermal energy from plasma.SOLUTION: A power system includes (i) a reaction cell for catalysis of atomic hydrogen to form hydrino, (ii) a chemical tactile mixture containing at least two components selected from a source of H2O catalyst or H2O catalyst; atomic hydrogen or a source of atomic hydrogen; H2O catalyst or a source of H2O catalyst and a reactant forming atomic hydrogen or a source of atomic hydrogen; at least one or more reactants for initiating catalyst reaction of atomic hydrogen; and a material for making fuel have high conductivity, (iii) an electrical power source for providing repeated short bursts of electrical energy and an electrode for confining fuel, (iv) a product recovery system, (v) a fuel pelletizer including a blast furnace, a source of hydrogen and a source of H2O, a dripper for forming fuel pellets or shots and a stirrer, and (vi) a solid or liquid fuel-plasma-electric power source for supplying at least one of electrical power and thermal power.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 1","Inventor Name":"RANDELL L MILLS","Assignee":"BRILLIANT WRITE POWER INC","Filing Date":"2020-12-03"},{"Document Number":"WO\/2012\/106637A1","Document Type":"WIPO","Publication Date":"2012-08-09","Title":"PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PARAFFINIC HYDROCARBONS","Abstract":"Reaction catalysts and supports as disclosed herein are utilized in a process for converting carboxylic acids, which are derived from molecules found in various feedstocks of biological origin as well as various byproducts of industrial processes, to linear paraffinic hydrocarbons, the latter being capable of use in various applications, including as an alternative source of fuel.","Inventor Name":"RATNASAMY PAUL (IN)","Assignee":"UNIV LOUISVILLE RES FOUND (US); RATNASAMY PAUL (IN)","Filing Date":"2012-02-03"},{"Document Number":"EP2670723A1","Document Type":"EP","Publication Date":"2013-12-11","Title":"PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PARAFFINIC HYDROCARBONS","Abstract":"Reaction catalysts and supports as disclosed herein are utilized in a process for converting carboxylic acids, which are derived from molecules found in various feedstocks of biological origin as well as various byproducts of industrial processes, to linear paraffinic hydrocarbons, the latter being capable of use in various applications, including as an alternative source of fuel.","Inventor Name":"RATNASAMY PAUL (IN)","Assignee":"UNIV LOUISVILLE RES FOUND (US)","Filing Date":"2012-02-03"},{"Document Number":"DE102022000497A1","Document Type":"DE","Publication Date":"2022-08-11","Title":"Reaktions- und Auslegungskonzept f\u00fcr Triebwerke zur katalytischen Steuerung \/ energetischen Ausl\u00f6sung (z.B. mit Metallzus\u00e4tzen) der inneren Geschwindigkeit (Beschleunigung) und Austrittsgeschwindigkeit mit Beeinflussung von Temperatur sowie Druck f\u00fcr einen verbesserten Wirkungsgrad und Brennraumanpassung (Treiber-Konzept)","Abstract":"Die Leistungsf\u00e4higkeit von chemischen Triebwerkssystemen (z.B.

Thus indetectable at night. Any incoming ordnance will deflect outwards because of turning couple caused by maximum resistance near surface and lower resistance inside. Essentially I maximize pressure and temperature without pollution, the most effective is circular motion to centrifuge the combustion process but it also works well on reciprocating engines.

Since a nozzle without a three-dimensional regulating structure in the middle is transformed with a reduction in the cross-sectional area thereof, and since some of the passages between vanes of a nozzle apparatus of a first turbine stage are closed, the velocity of the hot gases through the remaining open passages of the nozzle apparatus of the first turbine stage rises and the kinetic energy of said hot gases increases, leading to an increase in the energy which the hot gas transmits to the working vanes of the turbine, thus resulting in an increase in turbine power.","Inventor Name":"KUDRIASHOV MIKHAIL ANATOLYEVICH (UA)","Assignee":"KUDRIASHOV MIKHAIL ANATOLYEVICH (UA)","Filing Date":"2020-12-28"},{"Document Number":"WO\/2017\/217926A1","Document Type":"WIPO","Publication Date":"2017-12-21","Title":"LANDING PAD","Abstract":"A landing pad including at least one integrally formed elongated hollow decking unit having an elongated landing plate with a plurality of holes, an elongated base plate aligned longitudinally with respect to the elongated landing plate which is designed as an orifice plate and spaced a distance apart from the elongated landing plate, and two elongated side wall plates connecting the elongated landing plate to the elongated base plate.

The fossil fuel-melt-burning-arc is fired between a negative coal-electrode and a positive counter-electrode, in which the latter can be selected according to the type of method used. The arc-firing is conducted in a closed pressurized chamber vessel in which the counter electrode is formed. With firing of the arc between the negative electrode and counter-electrode an ignition-spark crosses between the electrodes, as a result of ionization of the inter-electrode medium, and the coal combusts at a maximum temperature of 7000 degrees C and above, with reaction-oxygen-to-carbon-dioxide occurring in the closed vessel.  An additional part of the required oxygen arises from the electrolytic decomposition of the water\/water vapor(steam) in which the negative charge carriers (hydrogen ions) drift to the positive counter-electrode and the positive charge carriers (oxygen ions) move to the negative carbon electrode. No flue-gas mass-flow losses occur prior to steam provision at the turbine, and in the pressure chamber vessel a fission-decomposition method occurs for obtaining hydrogen and oxygen combusted with coal at the electrode. The hydrogen given off at the positive electrode can be taken off.","Inventor Name":"Schl\u00fcter, Claus, Dipl.-Ing.

An initiator such as Marshall's acid is used to create methyl radicals. These radicals combine with sulfur trioxide to form methyl-sulfonate radicals. These radicals remove hydrogen from methane that is being added to the reactor, creating stable methanesulfonic acid (MSA, H3CSO3H) and new methyl radicals, to sustain a chain reaction while methane and S03 are continuously added to the reactor. Anhydrous conditions avoid the use or creation of water, and MSA in the reactor increases the solubility and reaction rates of methane and SO3. MSA can be heated to release methanol, or processed to create gasoline, dimethyl ether, formaldehyde, or other valuable liquids. Any SOS released by processing of MSA can be oxidized to S03 and recycled back into the system. Very high yields and selectivity (greater than 95%) have been shown in early tests.","Inventor Name":"RICHARDS ALAN K (US)","Assignee":"RICHARDS ALAN K (US)","Filing Date":"2004-06-21"},{"Document Number":"EP2263043B1","Document Type":"EP","Publication Date":"2013-01-23","Title":"QUARLS IN A BURNER","Abstract":"The invention relates to a quarl of a burner (1) for a gas turbine engine, in which fuel and air is mixed and provided to the burner (1) and wherein a quarl (4a, 4b, 4c) is arranged to house a main flame (7).

An injection opening of the air-fuel mixture injection pipe 61 is positioned in the vicinity of a wall surface opening of a combustor liner 51. Since the fuel-air mixture is injected so as to cross with burnt gas and is applied with swirling, mixing with the burnt gas is promoted, and generation of NOx by combustion is effectively restrained, and combustion is completed in a short time. Uniformity of the temperature distribution of the combustor outlet is improved, and the service life of a turbine part is lengthened.COPYRIGHT: (C)2006,JPO&NCIPI","Inventor Name":"HAYASHI SHIGERU","Assignee":"JAPAN AEROSPACE EXPLORATION","Filing Date":"2004-06-25"},{"Document Number":"EP1962046A1","Document Type":"EP","Publication Date":"2008-08-27","Title":"Pulse detonation combustor cleaning device and method of operation","Abstract":"A pulse detonation cleaner system is described.

The principle of the double rotary wing is in fact the main lift technique that is adaptable in the known field of aeronautics, but replaces the stationary wings of airplanes, and reduces drag, fuel consumption, vibration, and noise.","Inventor Name":"BUENDIA JOSE (FR); PERRICHON CLAUDE ANNIE (FR); GIRY FRANCOIS (FR); PICCALUGA PIERRE (CH)","Assignee":"BUENDIA JOSE (FR); PERRICHON CLAUDE ANNIE (FR); GIRY FRANCOIS (FR); PICCALUGA PIERRE (CH)","Filing Date":"2010-08-16"},{"Document Number":"JP2017501131A","Document Type":"JP","Publication Date":"2017-01-12","Title":"\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u4ea4\u63db\u6a39\u8102\u89e6\u5a92\u306b\u3088\u308b\u6df7\u5408\u30d6\u30c6\u30f3\u306e\u4e8c\u91cf\u5316\uff0f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b4\u30de\u30fc\u5316\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9","Abstract":"\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3\u4ea4\u63db\u6a39\u8102\u7cfb\u306e\u89e6\u5a92\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u6df7\u5408\u30d6\u30c6\u30f3\u4f9b\u7d66\u6750\u6599\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u7684\u306a\u4e8c\u91cf\u5316\u304a\u3088\u3073\u30aa\u30ea\u30b4\u30de\u30fc\u5316\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u4e8c\u91cf\u5316\u304a\u3088\u3073\u30aa\u30ea\u30b4\u30de\u30fc\u5316\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u3088\u308a\u9ad8\u3044\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u542b\u91cf\u3001\u3088\u308a\u9ad8\u3044\u30aa\u30af\u30bf\u30f3\u4fa1\u3001\u3088\u308a\u9ad8\u3044\u30aa\u30af\u30bf\u30f3\u611f\u5ea6\u304a\u3088\u3073\u3088\u308a\u4f4e\u3044RVP\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u512a\u308c\u305f\u71c3\u6599\u6df7\u5408\u6210\u5206\u3068\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3067\u304d\u308b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u306b\u5206\u5c90\u3057\u305fC8\u304a\u3088\u3073C8+\u30aa\u30ec\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\uff08\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u3001C12\u3001C16\u304a\u3088\u3073C20\u30aa\u30ec\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\uff09\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u3002","Inventor Name":"Sun; Shu, Way","Assignee":"Saudi Arabian Oil Company","Filing Date":"2014-11-21"},{"Document Number":"EP4227224A1","Document Type":"EP","Publication Date":"2023-08-16","Title":"HYBRID-ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT PROPULSION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR OPERATING THE SAME","Abstract":"A method of operating a hybrid-electric propulsion system (18) for an aircraft includes: a) providing at least one thermal engine sized to provide sufficient thrust to the aircraft for at least one flight mission independent of a second non-thermal engine source of thrust for the at least one flight mission; b) providing at least one electric motor powered by a non-hydrocarbon-fuel-burning electrical energy source, the at least one electric motor configured to provide thrust to the aircraft for the at least one flight mission; and c) selectively providing thrust during one or more segments of the at least one flight mission using the electric motor.\n","Inventor Name":"FREER RICHARD (CA); QUILLET DOMINIK (CA); RANCOURT DAVID (CA)","Assignee":"PRATT & WHITNEY CANADA (Longueuil, Qu\u00e9bec J4G 1A1, CA)","Filing Date":"2023-02-13"},{"Document Number":"JP7270111B2","Document Type":"JP","Publication Date":"2023-05-09","Title":"\u71c3\u713c\u5668\u306e\u904b\u8ee2\u52b9\u7387\u3068\u6392\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u3092\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3067\u304d\u308b\u71c3\u713c\u88c5\u7f6e","Abstract":"The present invention relates to a combustion device capable of maximizing a combustor's operation efficiency and exhaust performance and, more specifically, to a combustion device comprising: a gas nozzle unit that allows gas fuel to be supplied; a gas fuel distribution unit that is in communication with the gas nozzle unit to form a space and distributes gas fuel; a first mixing chamber that is in communication with the gas fuel distribution unit through a first through-hole to form a space in which gas fuel is premixed with air; a second mixing chamber that is in communication with the gas fuel distribution unit through a second through-hole to form a space in which gas fuel is premixed with air; a turbulence producing nozzle unit provided between the first mixing chamber and the second mixing chamber to produce a turbulent flow of a pre-mixture of gas fuel and air that are premixed in the first mixing chamber; and a swirl nozzle unit that is in communication with an air nozzle unit to allow air for combustion to be supplied into each of the first mixing chamber and the second mixing chamber.

Hydrazine and hydrazine blends have been considered for liquid gas generators because of their ability to decompose at ambient conditions on an iridium catalyst to form warm (1000\u00b0 F. to 1500\u00b0 F.) gases. Hydrazine is undesirable because of its toxicity and high melting point (34\u00b0 F.). The tertiary amine azides, which are defined hereinabove and below, are non-carcinogenic alternatives to hydrazine in liquid or gel gas generator systems. These tertiary amines azides are non-carcinogenic alternatives for use with a thermal reactor bed where exothermic reaction releases enough heat to sustain decomposition for furnishing gases for gas generator systems employed. A tertiary amine typically has three hydrocarbons moieties attached to the nitrogen atom. The tertiary amine azides of this invention can have no more than seven carbon atoms in the molecules. Further, these tertiary amine azides can contain no more than two azide moieties that are attached at the opposite end of the hydrocarbon portions from the amine nitrogen atom. A special case that still meet these requirements is pyrollidine moiety (five atom cyclic structure wherein each end of a linear four carbon atom structure is attached to a common nitrogen atom), and the common nitrogen atom has as attached ethyl azide moiety. A fuel gel propellant fuel that would be a suitable replacement for MMH must be less toxic and have a competitive density impulse for the same engine operating conditions. Three compounds meeting the specified requirements have been synthesized and their physical and chemical properties are evaluated herein as shown in Table 1.

The new turboprop incorporates 2 non-concentric spools aero-thermal-pressure coupled wherein staged compressor rotors lend to a simple engine design, optimized high overall engine pressure ratio (OPR) and low specific fuel consumption (SFC). An integral starter-generator system further simplifies the engine design and offers high electrical output power capability for auxiliary power requirements. A 2-stage low emissions combustor with fuel-air premix chambers is incorporated lending to stable combustion at any engine spool speed\/power requirement, further fuel optimization and use of a low cost simple fixed pitch propeller. Some other highlights include: any fuel or mixture thereof, TBO greater than piston or other turbine engines, less maintenance costs, oil\/filter change at \u02dc15000 hrs. and other inherent advantages of a gas turbine engine.\nOf the two spools that make up this turboprop engine, one is the High Pressure (HP) spool that is part of the gas generator using combustor hot gases to power the integral HP turbine rotor, HP compressor and high-speed alternator starter-generator. The other engine spool is the Low-Pressure (LP) spool that receives the HP turbine exhaust heat energy to power the integral LP compressor rotor, LP turbine rotor, integrated gearbox with resultant output shaft horsepower.\nThis invention represents the most advanced engine for general aviation since Charles Edward Taylor's engine powered the Wright Brothers first aircraft-controlled powered flight Dec. 17, 1903.","Inventor Name":"Teets, Joseph Michael (Hobe Sound, FL, US)","Assignee":"Assignee not found","Filing Date":"05\/22\/2020"},{"Document Number":"US20140161690","Document Type":"US","Publication Date":"06\/12\/2014","Title":"CONVERSION OF BIOMASS FEEDSTOCKS INTO HYDROCARBON LIQUID TRANSPORTATION FUELS","Abstract":"Methods for converting a carbon-containing feedstock into a fluid transportation fuel are described.

An autopilot system is programmed for rapid descent, in response to a cabin depressurization condition detected by an air pressure sensor, to a flight level where there is sufficient oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain full consciousness. When in the rapid descent mode, the autopilot cuts engine power to idle, reduces the angle of attack, maximizes parasitic drag, and initiates a maximum descent rate without exceeding the aircraft's design limitations. As the aircraft approaches a lower altitude capable of sustaining full human consciousness, the autopilot system increases the angle of attack, reduces parasitic drag, and increases engine power, thereby causing the aircraft to fly level at the lower altitude until the pilot reasserts control of the aircraft.","Inventor Name":"Fox III, Angus C.

The substitutent hydrocarbon radicals of the aromatic hydroxy compound and\/or the aromatic nucleus may be substituted by chlorine.  The substituents may be alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl groups, such as butyl to decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, octadecylenyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, ethylcyclohexyl, dimethylcyclohexyl, propylcyclohexyl, trimethylcyclohexyl, dicyclohexyl, methylated dicyclohexyl, benzyl or ethylphenyl.  The aromatic nuclus may be mono or dicyclic, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, tetraline or diphenyl.  The aldehyde is preferably formaldehyde or acetaldehyde.  The metal of the salt of the resinous condensation product is preferably an alkaline earth metal but may be another polyvalent metal such as copper, zinc, aluminium, lead, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium or tin. The salt, if difficulty soluble in oil, may be incorporated in oil as described in U.S. Specification 2,042,880 or in many cases may be dissolved in a solvent such as benzene, which may then, while adding oil, be gradually removed by passing an inert gas through the mixture at an elevated temperature.  The concentrate thus obtained may then be diluted with further oil. An example is given of the preparation of the calcium salt of a condensation product of formaldehyde and p-isooctylphenol.  The aromatic amine may contain one or more substituents, such as hydroxyl, chloro, alkoxy, hydroxyalkyl, amino, N-alkylated amino or N-alkylated amino alkylene, radicals.  Preferred anti-oxidants are the naphthylamines, primary, secondary or tertiary aryl or aralkyl amines having at least two aromatic rings, such as phenyl beta-naphthylamine, tetraline naphthylamine, alpha-alpha, alpha-beta or beta-beta dinaphthylamine, various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl naphthylamines, xenyl naphthylamines, benzyl-phenyl naphthylamines, diphenayl - naphthyl - amines, phenyl-xenyl naphthylamines, dixenyl-naphthylamines, and various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl phenyl amines.  In general the N-aryl substituted naphthylamines are preferred.  An example of a naphthylamine which is substituted by a second amino group is 1, 8 diamino naphthalene. Alternatively there may be used diamino diaryl alkanes such as diamino diphenyl methane, tetramethyl diamino triphenyl methane, tetra ethyl diamino triphenyl methane, diamino diphenyl ethane, and diamino ditolyl ethane, or alkylated diaryl amines such as p-ethyl diphenylamine, m-ethyl diphenylamine, p-isopropyl diphenylamine, mono-and polyamyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, hexadecyl, cyclohexyl, methyl cyclohexyl and other alkyl substituted diphenylamine and p-methoxy-p1-isopropyl diphenylamine.  The lubricating oil may also contain oil-soluble salts of bases such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, zinc, cadmium, aluminium, tin, chromium, nickel and cobalt (and of organic bases including primary, secondary, or tertiary amino and quaternary ammonium compounds) combined with such organic acids as fatty acids of 10-30 carbon atoms, wool fat acids, acids produced by oxidation of paraffin wax, chlorinated fatty acids, rosin acids, fatty and hydroxy fatty acids containing aromatic constituents, aromatic carboxylic acids including paraffin wax benzoic acids, alkyl salicylic acids, phthalic acid mono-esters, aromatic keto of ether acids, diphenols such as di(alkylphenol) sulphides and disulphides, sulphonic acids derived from alkyl aryl hydrocarbons or from high boiling petroleum oils, sulphuric acid mono-esters; phosphoric, arsenic and antimonic acid mono- and diesters, including mono- and di-esters of the corresponding thiophosphoric, thio arsenic and thio antimonic acids, phosphonic and arsonic acids.  Examples of these auxiliary detergents are the alkaline earth phosphate and thiophosphate di-esters and the alkaline earth diphenolates, specifically the calcium and barium salts of diphenol mono and polysulphides.  The calcium salts of oil-soluble petroleum sulphonic acid are said to be particularly advantageous.  Other auxiliary additives may include phosphatides such as lecithin, fatty oils such as rape oil, and voltolized fatty or mineral oils.  Anti-rusting compounds such as dicarboxylic acids of 16 or more carbon atoms or organic compounds containing an acidic radical very near to a nitrile, nitro or nitroso group (e.g. alpha cyano stearic acid) and alkali metal salts of sulphonic acids or fatty acids may also be present. Other additives such as blooming agents, pour-point depressants, viscosity improvers, auxiliary anti-oxidants, extreme pressure agents and anti-foaming agents may be present.  Examples of auxiliary anti-oxidants are alkyl phenols such as 2, 4, 6-trimethylphenol, pentamethylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-tertiary-butylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-octylphenol, 2, 6-ditertiary-butyl-4-methylphenol, and 2, 4, 6-tritertiary-butylphenol.

This system avoids the use or creation of water, and liquid MSA is an amphoteric solvent that increasing the solubility and reactivity of methane and SO3. MSA from this process can be sold or used as a valuable chemical with no mercaptan or halogen impurities, or it can be heated and cracked to release methanol (a clean fuel, gasoline additive, and chemical feedstock) and sulfur dioxide (which can be oxidized to SO3 and recycled back into the reactor).

A nozzle formed from the combustion chamber extends outward from the combustion chamber and tappers down to a narrow diameter and then opens into a wider diameter where the nozzle then terminates outside of said combustion chamber. The pressure created within the combustion chamber accelerates as it leaves the chamber through the nozzle resulting in pressure and heat escaping from the nozzle to the atmosphere outside the micro thrust and heat generator. The micro thrust and heat generator can be microfabricated from a variety of materials, e.g., of polysilicon, on one wafer using surface micromachining batch fabrication techniques or high aspect ratio micromachining techniques (LIGA).","Inventor Name":"Garcia, Ernest J.

The energy to support the endothermic reformation reaction converting hydrocarbon and water feedstock into hydrogen and carbon monoxide fuel is supplied by heat recovered from the oxidation process in the stack (14) of fuel cells (16). The source of hydrocarbons is desulfurized natural gas. Heat transfers to reformers (10) which may be incrementally shielded packed beds (30, 60) of the reactors (18, 19) of the reformer (10) by radiation from the stacks (14), furnace wall (38), or both and by forced convection from the exhausting airflow exiting the stack furnace (12). Temperature gradients in the reformer (10) may be controlled by selective (or incremented) radiation shielding (20) and by counterflow heat exchange to prevent excessive premature cracking in the reformer. Such an optimized design uses a minimum amount of catalyst, yet prevents carbonization from clogging interstices or otherwise rendering the catalyst or catalyst granules (32) ineffective.

[Class 7 (iii)] A carburetter body formed in two sections has a float chamber and a double Venturi cast integral with one of the sections. A downdraught carburetter comprises an upper body portion 8, preferably of aluminium alloy and formed by die casting, and a lower body portion 9 preferably of cast iron and formed as a plain tube with relatively thin walls and separated from the upper portion by a non- conducting gasket 10. A choke valve 13 mounted on a shaft 14 is provided with a poppet valve 15. The upper section is cast with a float chamber 21 and also with an inner Venturi 36 and an outer Venturi 34, this being made possible by a fin 38 which contains the nozzle in the form of a tubular member 45 held in place by a metering plug 53. Tube 45 is cut away on its outer surface at 54 to provide an air-bleed passage, which communicates at one end with the bore of the tube through ports 56, and at the other end with the main air passage through a duct 60. The tube is also cut away circumferentially at 62 to provide communication with an idling duct 64, 66 which leads, through passage 72, Fig. 4, to a nozzle 76 beyond the throttle valve 19. The throttle is actuated through a lever 82 and the other end of the spindle has an arm 88, Fig. 5, connected to one arm 92 of a jointed lever the other arm 93 of which is connected to the rod 98, Fig. 4, of an accelerating pump.

These reactions are thermally reversible by the removal of metal vapor in the reverse exchange. The hydrino reactions are maintained and regenerated in a batch mode using thermally-coupled multi-cells arranged in bundles wherein cells in the power-production phase of the cycle heat cells in the regeneration phase.

The escapelets, which can be provided in both aerodynamic and hydrodynamic structures, such as wings, tail sections; rotary blades, guy wire frames, wing sails, and various underwater keels and wing keels. The escapelets transfer energy from an inlet located in the high-pressure surface of the foil or foil body to an outlet located in the lower-pressure surface, allowing energy that would normally form a vortex at the tip of the foil to be redirected and dissipated in a beneficial way. As a result, drag is reduced and fuel economy is increased, while at the same time increasing the authority of ailerons and similar flight control surfaces, allowing aircraft that were not previously spin recovery rated to become spin recoverable.","Inventor Name":"Long, Donald James (San Jose, CA, US)","Assignee":"SUSTAINED ENERGY RECOVERY SYSTEMS, LLC (San Jose, CA, US)","Filing Date":"05\/29\/2009"},{"Document Number":"US20050080520","Document Type":"US","Publication Date":"04\/14\/2005","Title":"Waste recovery and material handling process to replace the traditional trash transfer station and landfil by extracting reusable material and energy from joined refuse streams to include; office waste, dry waste, wet garbage and the special hazardous material handling of biological, chemical, and nuclear waste","Abstract":"This innovative technology involves stationary as well as, portable application in the form of a waste material recovery and conversion center\/power plant, which is termed The Recovery Center.

Computers on board the spaceship determine any necessary course corrections for the projectiles based upon the spaceship's sensor system. Appropriate commands are radioed to the projectiles which execute the commanded maneuvers to alter their trajectories. The spaceship carries a second EMPL and a nuclear-powered electricity generating facility to provide electricity to operate the EMPL. The spaceship, the second EMPL and the nuclear power facility are all rotated axially about the long axis of the EMPL to provide both gyroscopic stabilization and also artifical gravity for the crew of the spaceship. The second EMPL is used to catch the projectiles which transfers the momentum of the projectiles to the spaceship thereby accelerating it in the desired direction. Additional acceleration of the spaceship is achieved by again launching the captured projectiles in a direction opposite to the desired direction of motion of the spaceship. The spaceship can be decelerated in a similar manner. Mars can be reached in two months using this system.","Inventor Name":"Willis, Robert C.

The strake fence flap is deployed along the upper surface of each of the strakes on the canard aircraft. The strake fence flap is hinged along its lower edge which allows it to be retracted and extended as needed. In the cruise configuration, the strake fence flap is folded flush with the strake upper surface. For deceleration or landing where increased lift and drag are required, the strake fence flap is extended. The frontal area of the strake fence flap becomes exposed resulting in additional drag. The geometry and positioning of the fence causes the flow to separate from the upper edge of the fence and to roll up into a vortex which trails over the strake. The intense suction which accompanies the vortex acts directly on the strake upper surface, thereby significantly increasing the lift.","Inventor Name":"Vess, Robert J.

The superagile aircraft is characterized by articulatable air inlets, articulatable exhaust nozzles, highly deflectable canard surfaces, and control thruster jets located around the nose of the fuselage, on the top and bottom surfaces of the propulsion system near the exhaust nozzles, and on both sides of at least one vertical tail. The method of operating the superagile aircraft comprises the step of articulating the air inlets and exhaust nozzles, deflecting the canard surfaces, and vectoring the thruster jets so that supernormal flight is attained. Supernormal flight may be defined as flight at which the superagile aircraft operates at an angle of attack much greater than the angle of attack which produces maximum lift. In supernormal flight, the superagile aircraft is capable of almost vertical ascents, sharp turns, and very steep descents without losing control. Enhanced survivability of the pilot and the aircraft is achieved by the invention.","Inventor Name":"Strom, Thomas H. (Newport News, VA)","Assignee":"Dynamic Engineering, Inc.

The main and basic invention is Nuclear Aircraft Transportation System \u201cKARAVAN\u201d (NATS). This invention includes two other ones: Aircraft Thrust Nuclear Power Plant, (ATNPP), which in turn includes\u2014Thermal Power Cycle of ATNPP, (TPC ATNPP). In addition, the represented group of inventions is made up of two more inventions: Maintenance System of ATNPP, (MS ATNPP) and Emergency Response System of NATSK, (ERS NATSK).\nThe concept of practical implementation of the presented group of inventions involves the fact that ATNPP, which is a large unmanned drone aircraft \u201cTiagach\u201d, supplies the aero-train composed of a number of passenger liners and cargo transport planes using electric motors with traction electric energy in the air.\nThe power supply of such an aero-train is based on the onboard Nuclear Power Plant of the aircraft \u201cTiagach\u201d. In this case, the transmission of electric power to the towed electric aircraft of the aero-train is carried out by means of electric split feeders and cables, connecting and disconnecting of which between airplanes of the aero-train is carried out in the air, by analogy with refueling of airplanes in the air with JP fuel.\nDuring the flight of the aero-train on a logistically optimized route, electric airplanes can detach from and attach to the aero-train, taking off and landing along the flight route of the aero-train using their own electric accumulators. In addition, extra ATNPP may be included in the aero-train during its flight, if it is necessary to increase the thrust. At the same time, due to the use of nuclear power, such ATNPP can remain in the air for a conditionally indefinite period of time.\nThe invention is aimed at creating cost-effective air freight and passenger traffic.","Inventor Name":"Sevastyanov, Vladimir Petrovich (Novosibirsk, RU)                \n                            Petrov, Oleksii Ivanovich (Kiev, UA)                \n                            Varygin, Vitalii Nikolaevich (Novosibirsk, RU)","Assignee":"Assignee not found","Filing Date":"11\/29\/2019"},{"Document Number":"9771824","Document Type":"US","Publication Date":"09\/26\/2017","Title":"Method and system for an electric and steam supply system","Abstract":"An electric and steam system includes an electrical generator assembly configured to receive a first portion of a flow of a boil off gas (NBOG).

The proposed process effects the separation of CO2 from a mixture of gases (such as flue gas\/fuel gas) by its reaction with metal oxides (such as calcium oxide). The Calcium based Reaction Separation for CO2 (CaRS-CO2) process consists of contacting a CO2 laden gas with calcium oxide (CaO) in a reactor such that CaO captures the CO2 by the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Once \u201cspent\u201d, CaCO3 is regenerated by its calcination leading to the formation of fresh CaO sorbent and the evolution of a concentrated stream of CO2. The \u201cregenerated\u201d CaO is then recycled for the further capture of more CO2. This carbonation-calcination cycle forms the basis of the CaRS-CO2 process. This process also identifies the application of a mesoporous CaCO3 structure, developed by a process detailed elsewhere, that attains >90% conversion over multiple carbonation and calcination cycles. Lastly, thermal regeneration (calcination) under vacuum provided a better sorbent structure that maintained reproducible reactivity levels over multiple cycles.","Inventor Name":"Fan, Liang-shih (Columbus, OH, US)                \n                            Gupta, Himanshu (Columbus, OH, US)","Assignee":"The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH, US)","Filing Date":"02\/06\/2003"},{"Document Number":"US20100097208","Document Type":"US","Publication Date":"04\/22\/2010","Title":"Method and System for Tracking Assets","Abstract":"The present invention provides a device for tracking a mobile or portable asset.

The substitutent hydrocarbon radicals of the aromatic hydroxy compound and\/or the aromatic nucleus may be substituted by chlorine.  The substituents may be alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl groups, such as butyl to decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, octadecylenyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, ethylcyclohexyl, dimethylcyclohexyl, propylcyclohexyl, trimethylcyclohexyl, dicyclohexyl, methylated dicyclohexyl, benzyl or ethylphenyl.  The aromatic nuclus may be mono or dicyclic, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, tetraline or diphenyl.  The aldehyde is preferably formaldehyde or acetaldehyde.  The metal of the salt of the resinous condensation product is preferably an alkaline earth metal but may be another polyvalent metal such as copper, zinc, aluminium, lead, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium or tin. The salt, if difficulty soluble in oil, may be incorporated in oil as described in U.S. Specification 2,042,880 or in many cases may be dissolved in a solvent such as benzene, which may then, while adding oil, be gradually removed by passing an inert gas through the mixture at an elevated temperature.  The concentrate thus obtained may then be diluted with further oil. An example is given of the preparation of the calcium salt of a condensation product of formaldehyde and p-isooctylphenol.  The aromatic amine may contain one or more substituents, such as hydroxyl, chloro, alkoxy, hydroxyalkyl, amino, N-alkylated amino or N-alkylated amino alkylene, radicals.  Preferred anti-oxidants are the naphthylamines, primary, secondary or tertiary aryl or aralkyl amines having at least two aromatic rings, such as phenyl beta-naphthylamine, tetraline naphthylamine, alpha-alpha, alpha-beta or beta-beta dinaphthylamine, various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl naphthylamines, xenyl naphthylamines, benzyl-phenyl naphthylamines, diphenayl - naphthyl - amines, phenyl-xenyl naphthylamines, dixenyl-naphthylamines, and various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl phenyl amines.  In general the N-aryl substituted naphthylamines are preferred.  An example of a naphthylamine which is substituted by a second amino group is 1, 8 diamino naphthalene. Alternatively there may be used diamino diaryl alkanes such as diamino diphenyl methane, tetramethyl diamino triphenyl methane, tetra ethyl diamino triphenyl methane, diamino diphenyl ethane, and diamino ditolyl ethane, or alkylated diaryl amines such as p-ethyl diphenylamine, m-ethyl diphenylamine, p-isopropyl diphenylamine, mono-and polyamyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, hexadecyl, cyclohexyl, methyl cyclohexyl and other alkyl substituted diphenylamine and p-methoxy-p1-isopropyl diphenylamine.  The lubricating oil may also contain oil-soluble salts of bases such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, zinc, cadmium, aluminium, tin, chromium, nickel and cobalt (and of organic bases including primary, secondary, or tertiary amino and quaternary ammonium compounds) combined with such organic acids as fatty acids of 10-30 carbon atoms, wool fat acids, acids produced by oxidation of paraffin wax, chlorinated fatty acids, rosin acids, fatty and hydroxy fatty acids containing aromatic constituents, aromatic carboxylic acids including paraffin wax benzoic acids, alkyl salicylic acids, phthalic acid mono-esters, aromatic keto of ether acids, diphenols such as di(alkylphenol) sulphides and disulphides, sulphonic acids derived from alkyl aryl hydrocarbons or from high boiling petroleum oils, sulphuric acid mono-esters; phosphoric, arsenic and antimonic acid mono- and diesters, including mono- and di-esters of the corresponding thiophosphoric, thio arsenic and thio antimonic acids, phosphonic and arsonic acids.  Examples of these auxiliary detergents are the alkaline earth phosphate and thiophosphate di-esters and the alkaline earth diphenolates, specifically the calcium and barium salts of diphenol mono and polysulphides.  The calcium salts of oil-soluble petroleum sulphonic acid are said to be particularly advantageous.  Other auxiliary additives may include phosphatides such as lecithin, fatty oils such as rape oil, and voltolized fatty or mineral oils.  Anti-rusting compounds such as dicarboxylic acids of 16 or more carbon atoms or organic compounds containing an acidic radical very near to a nitrile, nitro or nitroso group (e.g. alpha cyano stearic acid) and alkali metal salts of sulphonic acids or fatty acids may also be present. Other additives such as blooming agents, pour-point depressants, viscosity improvers, auxiliary anti-oxidants, extreme pressure agents and anti-foaming agents may be present.  Examples of auxiliary anti-oxidants are alkyl phenols such as 2, 4, 6-trimethylphenol, pentamethylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-tertiary-butylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-octylphenol, 2, 6-ditertiary-butyl-4-methylphenol, and 2, 4, 6-tritertiary-butylphenol.  The compounded lubricating oil is especially suitable for use in aviation engines.","Inventor Name":"Griffin Jr., John R.                \n                            Ess, Paul Van R.","Assignee":"Shell, Dev","Filing Date":"05\/01\/1945"},{"Document Number":"US20030093187","Document Type":"US","Publication Date":"05\/15\/2003","Title":"PFN\/TRAC systemTM FAA upgrades for accountable remote and robotics control to stop the unauthorized use of aircraft and to improve equipment management and public safety in transportation","Abstract":"This invention, a Protected Primary Focal Node PFN is a Trusted Remote Activity Controller TRAC and mobile communication router platform that provides accountable remote and robotics control to transportation vehicles by interfacing with the vehicles E\/E systems.

This inflated surface is then used as a guide for constructing the hull of the structure by wrapping the surface with long sheets of high strength material until the desired wall thickness and rigidity is obtained. The wrapping process is accomplished automatically by a wrapping machine. Since the inflatable surface can be packaged into a small volume, and since the sheets of wrapping material can be rolled into spools with very high packing density, it is possible to construct large continuous-walled pressurized structures in orbit using robotics with relatively few Shuttle flights. The method is used to construct a large permanently manned orbiting space station that provides an artificial gravity environment for the living quarters and connecting variable gravity environments for research and materials processing. The basic structural design of the space station consists of a rotating torus with three connecting spoke cylinders and two Earth-fixed column cylinders extending along the rotation axis mounted on each side of the torus'  hub.","Inventor Name":"Minovitch, Michael A.

The airfoil is provided with a plurality of apertures and a source of pressurized fluid for providing a flow of fluid through the apertures to establish an aerodynamic radius. The aerodynamic radius of curvature of leading edge is sufficiently greater than the mechanical radius of curvature of the leading edge that peak heat flux is independent of the mechanical radius of curvature. The mechanical radius of curvature is preferably less than 50% of the aerodynamic radius of curvature during hypersonic operation. Preferably the mechanical radius of curvature is the smallest allowed by the fabrication method (i.e., a knife edge), such as being less than about 0.02 inches, preferably less than about 0.01 inches. The transpiration blowing rate can be adjusted so that the blowing rate and aerodynamic radius of curvature are relatively low except during periods of maximum heat flux, such as the shock-on-lip point. Since the mechanical radius of curvature is effectively zero, control of the aerodynamic radius of curvature provides complete control of peak heat flux. By adjusting blowing rate to the minimum necessary at any given velocity, transpiration consumption, drag and fuel injection are reduced or eliminated.","Inventor Name":"Bulman, Melvin J.

The jyrodyne comprises a central fuselage with biplane-type wings arranged in a negative stagger arrangement, a horizontal ducted fan inlet shroud located at the center of gravity in the top biplane wing, a rotor mounted in the shroud, outrigger wing support landing gear, a forward mounted canard wing and passenger compartment, a multiple vane-type air deflector system for control and stability in VTOL mode, a separate tractor propulsion system for forward flight, and a full-span T-tail. Wingtip extensions on the two main wings extend aft to attach to the T-tail. The powerplants consist of two four cylinder two-stroke reciprocating internal combustion engines. Power from the engines is distributed between the ducted fan and tractor propeller through the use of a drivetrain incorporating two pneumatic clutches, controlled by an automotive style footpedal to the left of the rudder pedals. When depressed, power is transmitted to the ducted fan for vertical lift. When released, power is transmitted to the tractor propeller for forward flight. The aircraft can also takeoff and land in the conventional manner with a much larger payload, and is easily converted to amphibious usage. Landing gear is a bicycle arrangement with outriggers. The aircraft combines twin engines, heavy-duty landing gear, controlled-collapse crashworthy seats with a low stall speed and high resistance to stalls to eliminate any region of the flight regime where an engine or drivetrain failure could cause an uncontrollable crash.","Inventor Name":"Churchman, Charles Gilpin (Norcross, GA, US)","Assignee":"CHURCHMAN CHARLES GILPIN","Filing Date":"12\/09\/2002"},{"Document Number":"US20040021040","Document Type":"US","Publication Date":"02\/05\/2004","Title":"Container cabin for orbital vehicle","Abstract":"A method for developing and utilizing a Space Cruiser vehicle efficiently combines resources from relevant end users in industry and the military.

The circuit operates at a modest, for example, approximately 1.8 kV, tank circuit voltage to further reduce switching device leakage current related stresses at elevated temperatures allowing relatively long capacitor charge cycles, increased upper operating temperature capability and improved reliability. The circuit uses a low side switch circuit topology for releasing energy from said capacitor to ground whereby negative polarity energy is applied to the exciter.","Inventor Name":"Wilmot, Theodore S.

When airborne a rotor pylon latch is released and the pilot flies the rotor system aft about its pivot to the fuselage to form the tail of a high speed jet propelled airplane. Altering the pitch angle of the blades controls the aircraft, called a convertiblade, for helicopter-autogiro and airplane configurations and for moving the rotor between its configurations. The rotor is revved up with rocket fuel piped to burner jet nozzles located at the blade tips. A jump-take-off may be used to efficiently get the convertiblade airborne at a good climbing speed. Prior to landing, the rotor blades are released from their operation as roll control surfaces for the airplane configuration; then, they are permitted to rev-up and act as a brake to reduce the speed of the airplane. At a suitable speed, the pylon is released from the fuselage and the rotor system is flown by the pilot's controls up into autogiro configuration where it automatically latches permitting the pilot to make a flared autogiro landing. The transition between autogiro and airplane takes place in a very short period of time. The fuselage is kept stable during the transitions by the pilot's controls and by establishing lateral, directional, and longitudinal stability through relationships between the center of gravity and the center of all fin-areas of the aircraft for each regime of flight. Several methods of augmenting the rotor controls during transition are presented including the use of combined wing tip elevators and ailerons.","Inventor Name":"Prewitt, Richard H.

It produces the compressed air for a combustion chamber which feeds a large lift-fan turbine. That is the implementation of lift-fan mode. The boost compressor has more stages than the front fan and is a big added load. The gas turbine engine is supercharged to turn that added load: Part of the boost compressor output is taken during VTOL. This is a new version of the supercharging.

The proposed process effects the separation of CO2 from a mixture of gases by its reaction with metal oxides.

Once \u201cspent\u201d, CaCO3 is regenerated by its calcination leading to the formation of fresh CaO sorbent. The \u201cregenerated\u201d CaO is then recycled for the further capture of more CO2.

A small anti-torque rotor toward the tail of the aircraft, driven by a hydraulic motor provides the necessary force to overcome the main rotor's torque. A pair of high-aspect-ratio wings supported by wing struts on both sides of the fuselage provide highly efficient lift during cruising flight with very little induced drag.

In this invention gas compression takes place by using pinwheel-like thrusters to induce a very high velocity full forced vortex in the gas being compressed. Much higher \u201ctip\u201d velocities can be achieved because no strength-limited solid centrifugal impeller is required to spin up the gas. Due to the consequent very high vortex velocity a single stage pressure ratio of twenty five to one, or more, may be possible. Because there is no high pressure turbine, the gas pressure delivered to some downstream useful work device is much higher than is the case with conventional gas turbine engines. The invention's compressor requires no major moving parts except for the gas flow. The consequence is that the invention is predicted to have substantially better performance and general characteristics than conventional gas turbine engines.","Inventor Name":"Richards Jr., Chester L.

The turbofan blade 40 includes a leading edge 55, a trailing edge 58, and two side surfaces including a high-pressure side surface 49 and a low-pressure side surface 52. At least one of the two side surfaces has an essentially smooth surface portion 61 located between the leading and trailing edges, and the essentially smooth surface portion is interrupted by a surface deviation 64. The surface deviation is configured to fix a positionally unstable laminar to turbulent boundary layer transition 24 at a location toward the trailing edge from the surface deviation during operation of the turbofan blade in the turbofan assembly. In this manner, fatigue inducing and\/or structurally damaging unsteady aerodynamic forces experienced upon the blade and\/or fan disc during operation are controlled, and the resultant fluctuating fan blade and disc peak stresses are mitigated.","Inventor Name":"Mills, Robert J.

With OZ the information is presented as an integrated whole, the pilot instantaneously recognizes flight path deviations, and is instinctively drawn to the corrective maneuvers. Our laboratory studies indicate that OZ transfers to the pilot all of the integrated display information in less than 200 milliseconds. The reacquisition of scan can be accomplished just as quickly. Thus, the time constants for forming a mental model are near instantaneous. The pilot's ability to keep up with rapidly changing and threatening environments is tremendously enhanced.

The adaptation of combustion rate, combustion pressure, combustion temperature, latent heat and other conditions (e.g. heat reflections) can be used in a variety of technological ways. This enables optimization of combustion chamber geometry and, for example, reduction of profile losses. Lossy energy conversions are to be minimized, or specifically adapted (e.g. to a variable ambient pressure during vertical starts). To protect the adapted combustion, methods are named to avoid e.g. fouling, aging of the reactive surface, destructive pressure shocks and especially thermal damage. The potential through further technological additions, e.g. by means of contactless ignition or superordinate process concept is pointed out.","Inventor Name":"Herrmann, Mathias (Erfurt, DE)","Assignee":"Herrmann, Mathias (Erfurt, DE)","Filing Date":"02\/10\/2022"},{"Document Number":"4738695","Document Type":"US","Publication Date":"04\/19\/1988","Title":"Gas removal system","Abstract":"A portable gas removal system for withdrawing a flammable gas from a low pressure subterranean formation wherein the gas is aspirated from a well with water, the mixture of gas and water are introduced into a receiving chamber where the aspirated gas is stripped and mixed with air and an air-gas mixture is withdrawn having a gas concentration lower than the explosive limit.","Inventor Name":"Carr, Ivan H.

After measuring the residue, the analyzer automatically recomputes temperatures at a series of percentage volumes of evaporated sample. An IR beam meniscus detector is driven by a stepping motor screw-drive mechanism actuated via the microcomputer to find the initial meniscus position and track the rising meniscus.

The plasma actuators offer high body force as well as high force to weight ratios (thrust density). The flexibility and mechanical robustness of the actuators allows them to be shaped to conform to the surface to which they are applied. Carbon nanotube (CNT) based electrodes serve to further decrease the weight and profile of the actuators while maintaining flexibility while insulating nano-inclusions in the matrix enable tailoring of the mechanical properties. Such actuators are required for flow control in aeronautics and moving machinery such as wind turbines, noise abatement in landing gear and rotary wing aircraft and other applications.","Inventor Name":"Sauti, Godfrey (Hampton, VA, US)                \n                            XU, Tian-bing (Hampton, VA, US)                \n                            Siochi, Emilie J.

The wings and propellers are integrated to the hull by an outrigger designed to be very stiff and to distribute forces from the wings and propellers to the hull. The hull is shaped to provide aerodynamic lift in an airstream and to facilitate construction by minimizing the number of panels of differing curvature required. The hull is formed of a pressure tensioned frame covered with semi-rigid panels, a lower cladding frame and bow and stem cladding nose cones. The semi-rigid panels covering the frame are formed of gas-tight and abrasion resistant laminate material and are connected to the frame by means of an interface rib and latch system. The frame is formed of a plurality of curved elongate segments arranged in series orthogonal to the long axis of the hull and connected by means of torsion members.

The dispatcher analyzes each flight before its commencement and imposes restrictions designed to promote flight safety. The dispatcher monitors the flight in progress to ensure the pilot's compliance with all directives. For most enrollees, participation in the FRMS is a mandatory condition precedent to the pilot's insurance coverage. Thus, the potential loss of insurance coverage enforces compliance.

By employing sensors with different electrodes, the sensitivity to ice may be traded off against the ability to measure greater ice thickness. A sensor with small spacing between electrodes will exhibit a large change in capacitance when covered by a thin layer of ice, however, the capacitance change will be linear only for very thin layers of ice. A sensor with greater spacing between electrodes is less sensitive to ice accretion but has a correspondingly greater ice thickness measurement range. Accordingly, sensor (55) is relatively sensitive and is employed to determine whether or not ice or water is present.

The wing-drive is capable of independent movement about three rotational degrees of movement; movement about a flap axis is independent of movement about a yaw axis, and both are independent of changes in the pitch of the wing. Methods of controlling the wing-drive mechanism to affect a desired wing trajectory include the use of a non-linear automated controller that generates input signals to the wing-drive mechanism by comparing actual and desired wing trajectories in real time. Specification of wing trajectories is preferably also accomplished in real time using an automated trajectory specification system, which can include a fuzzy logic processor or a neural network. A vehicle that derives controlled motion as a whole from the wing-drive mechanism is also disclosed.","Inventor Name":"Smith, Michael J. C. (Bellevue, WA)","Assignee":"SMITH MICHAEL J.
