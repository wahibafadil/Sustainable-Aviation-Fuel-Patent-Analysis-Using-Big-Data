EP4321603A1,EP,2024-02-14,LAUNDRY DETERGENT COMPOSITION,"Laundry detergent compositions, water-soluble unit dose detergent products and methods of making each, are described. The laundry detergent compositions include renewable components, can be biodegradable, have a low carbon footprint and free of materials with a potential hazard concern, while still providing consumer acceptable performance. Packaging containing such laundry detergent compositions or water-soluble unit dose detergent products are also described.",KEULEERS ROBBY RENILDE FRANÃ‡OIS (BE); VINSON PHILLIP KYLE (US); SOUTER PHILIP FRANK (GB); STALMANS MARC H J (BE),"PROCTER & GAMBLE (Cincinnati, OH 45202, US)",2023-08-10
11879099,US,01/23/2024,Method for making liquid hydrocarbons,"A Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process with a hybrid membrane/PSA configuration provides high component recoveries from FT off gas with minimum power consumption. Synthesis gas from a synthesis gas production zone is reacted in an FT reaction zone forming a liquid stream and an off gas stream. The off gas from the FT reaction zone, which contains hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane reactants, is recycled to the synthesis gas production zone. A purge stream from the recycle loop is sent to a membrane separation unit where it is separated into a permeate stream and a residue stream. The residue stream is separated in a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit into a fuel gas stream and a second stream. The second stream can be compressed and recycled to the synthesis gas production zone.","Russell, Bradley (Fall Branch, TN, US)

5304036,US,04/19/1994,Autogyro aircraft,"An autogyro aircraft has freewheeling rotor blades that provide lift. A separate pusher propeller provides forward thrust. The rotor system (20) has a collective arm (30) as a control for selectively setting and maintaining a tension force on a collective cable to regulate the rotor blade angle of attack or pitch angle between a no-lift attitude and a positive lift angle. The collective arm (30) sets a tension on collective cable against a coil spring biasing. The collective arm is connected to pivot or tilt a pitch change horn assembly and, in turn, connected rotor blades. The collective arm can be selectively set and maintained and released and reset both on the ground and in flight.","Groen, Henry J. (Salt Lake City, UT)

5544844,US,08/13/1996,Autogyro aircraft,"An autogyro has a teetering semi-rigid rotary wing with rigid rotor blades. The angle of attack (blade pitch) of the rotor blades is fully adjustable in flight continuously over an operational range, and varies along the blade length. A prerotator rotates the rotor blades up to takeoff speed at minimum drag, no lift and optimum engine efficiency. Engine power is disconnected from the rotor blades and their angle of attack is changed for optimum lift to facilitate smooth vertical takeoff. Rotor blade pitch is likewise adjusted during vertical landing. In flight, rotor blade angle of attack is varied to adjust autorotation, lift and drag at any flight airspeed. On the ground, the rotary wing is braked to prevent rotation.The autogyro may roll, pitch, or yaw, with complete independence of blade pitch with respect to all other relative motions. The pedals have disproportionate forward and backward motions. The autogyro has retractable gear capable of fail-safe gear-up landing.","Groen, Henry J. (Salt Lake City, UT)

US20090152391,US,06/18/2009,Multibody aircrane,"The MULTIBODY AIRCRANE performs relative positioning, predictive control, and ballast control to achieve very heavy-lifting tasks on land or sea. Such tasks allow station keeping and precise transfer of very heavy payloads between ships underway. This scalable multibody system features three subcomponents: AIRSHIP, SKYCRANE and LOADFRAME. This semi-autonomous system combines aerodynamic (kinetic) and aerostatic (buoyancy force) lift with efficient power and propulsion. During low-speed flight, the Airship and Skycrane are decoupled but linked via a reelable Tether Control Line. Beneath the Skycrane, centered on its hull, a patented NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) RoboCrane (featuring a computer controlled six degrees of freedom (DoF) cabling system,) is attached, to precisely suspend and control a Loadframe, with or without payload. During subsonic forward flight, these Airship and Skycrane are coupled as a single airframe (fuselage and delta wing.)","Mcwhirk, Bruce Kimberly (Brookline, MA, US)",Assignee not found,03/02/2007
5823468,US,10/20/1998,Hybrid aircraft,"A hybrid aircraft is taught having VTOL, R-VTOL and S-STOL capabilities. The aircraft has a lifting body hull and four wing sections arranged in tandem which are pivotally moveable about their neutral axis. Each wing section has mounted thereon a pivotal propeller-rotor assembly for providing thrust substantially in a range between horizontal and vertical. The wings and propellers are integrated to the hull by an outrigger designed to be very stiff and to distribute forces from the wings and propellers to the hull. The hull is shaped to provide aerodynamic lift in an airstream and to facilitate construction by minimizing the number of panels of differing curvature required. The hull is formed of a pressure tensioned frame covered with semi-rigid panels, a lower cladding frame and bow and stem cladding nose cones. The semi-rigid panels covering the frame are formed of gas-tight and abrasion resistant laminate material and are connected to the frame by means of an interface rib and latch system. The frame is formed of a plurality of curved elongate segments arranged in series orthogonal to the long axis of the hull and connected by means of torsion members. A turbo-electric drive system can be used to drive the aircraft. An advanced hybrid aircraft is also described having about 8 to 12 high speed fans in place of the propeller-rotors.","Bothe, Hans-jurgen (Sherwood Park, Alberta, CA)",BOTHE; HANS-JURGEN,10/24/1995
