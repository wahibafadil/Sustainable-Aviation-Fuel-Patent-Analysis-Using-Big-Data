US20120090325,US,04/19/2012,ETHANOL PRODUCTION SYSTEM FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY,"A process for enhancing the energy output of an ethanol production facility has the steps of producing ethanol and stillage from a feedstock, anaerobically digesting said stillage so as to produce carbon dioxide and methane, compressing the methane, compressing the carbon dioxide, and, passing the compressed carbon dioxide to an oil-bearing formation. The compressed carbon dioxide is injected under pressure into the oil-bearing formation so as to produce live crude and natural gas. The compressed methane is delivered to a combustion turbine so as to produced power and an exhaust. The exhaust of the combustion turbine is passed to a steam turbine so as to produce steam and power.","Lewis, Michael J. (Houston, TX, US)",LEWIS MICHAEL J.,01/07/2011
US20180222580,US,08/09/2018,VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING AIRCRAFT,"The disclosure generally pertains to a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft comprising a fuselage and at least one fixed wing. The aircraft may include at least two powered rotors located generally along a longitudinal axis of the fuselage. The rotor units may be coupled to the fuselage via a rotating chassis, which allows the rotors to provide directed thrust by movement of the rotor units about at least one axis. The VTOL aircraft may include instructions to perform a degraded rotor landing protocol. The degraded rotor landing protocol may include adjusting a power to an operable rotor unit to control a rate of descent and/or slow a rate of acceleration toward a landing surface. The VTOL aircraft may be configured to impact the landing surface from a substantially vertical configuration, and adjust a thrust vector to cause the aircraft to come to rest in a generally upright configuration.","Delorean, Paul J.
