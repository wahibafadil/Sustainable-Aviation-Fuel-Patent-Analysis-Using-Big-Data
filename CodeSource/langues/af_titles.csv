5524587,US,06/11/1996,Sliding vane engine,"A sliding vane engine, where the vanes slide with at least of one of an axial and radial component of vane motion, and where the compression ratio of the engine may be variably controlled. The engine includes a stator and a rotor in relative rotation, and a plurality of vanes in rotor slits defining one or more main chamber cells and one or more vane slit cells. The vanes contain extended pins that move in a pin channel for controlling the sliding motion of the vane. Fuel is mixed by incorporating air turbulence generators at or near the intake region. The intake and exhaust regions of the engine also incorporate a wave pumping mechanism for injecting and scavenging air from the main chamber cells and the vane slits. The compression ratio of the engine may be varied while the engine is in operation, and the engine geometry provides for an extended temporal duration at about peak compression. The engine is insulated by using segmented ceramic inserts on the stator and rotor surfaces.","Mallen, Brian D. (Charlottesville, VA)

10317904,US,06/11/2019,Underwater leading drone system,"Systems and methods are provided for least one leading drone configured to move to a leading drone future location based on a future location of a base station. A set of base station future locations may form a base station path for the base station to traverse. Also, a set of leading drone future locations may form a leading drone path for the leading drone to traverse. The base station's future location may be anticipated from a prediction or a predetermination. The leading drone, navigating along the leading drone path, may collect sensor data and/or perform tasks. The leading drone may interact with sensor drones while traversing the leading drone path. Accordingly, the leading drone may move ahead of the base station in motion, as opposed to following or remaining with the base station.","Tu, Haofeng (Shanghai, CN)","Pinnacle Vista, LLC (Upland, CA, US)",05/05/2017
5591901,US,01/07/1997,Fluid sensor,"A sensor can detect the difference in potential between itself and the fluid into which it is immersed, a signal generated by the probe representing this difference in potential. This signal is used to activate an oscillator circuit. By varying the conditions at which current in the oscillator circuit begins to oscillate, various liquids can be detected and identified.","Heckman, James R.

11428157,US,08/30/2022,Enhanced aero diesel engine,"A ferritic aero diesel engine. The ferritic aero diesel engine includes an iron crankcase, a steel crankshaft and eight steel piston assemblies. The iron crankcase has a flat, horizontally opposed eight cylinder arrangement with a first set of cylinder walls defining a first set of cylinders in a first bank and a second set of cylinder walls defining a second set of cylinders in an opposed second bank. The steel crankshaft is rotatably mounted at least partially within the iron crankcase. Each of the steel piston assemblies of the plurality of steel piston assemblies is received within a respective cylinder of the iron crankcase and is coupled to the steel crankshaft. The first and second sets of cylinder walls have a minimum wall thickness of between approximately 4.8 and 5.2 mm.","Fuchs, Michael J. (New Richmond, WI, US)
