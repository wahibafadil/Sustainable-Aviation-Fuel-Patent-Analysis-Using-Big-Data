The following technical results are achieved: increased flight safety and manoeuvring safety, increased load-bearing capacity and flight height in ground effect mode, reduced dimensions, improved take-off and landing characteristics, amphibian characteristics and economic efficiency, increased functionality and a wider range of operational alignments, and greater ease of use and maintenance. The above-mentioned result is achieved by the simultaneous application to the ""flying wing"" or ""composite wing"" design layouts of the methods for generating a system of aerodynamic forces, the structural solutions and the piloting methods conceptually linked therewith which are proposed in the present group of inventions. To ensure full longitudinal stability, the actual character of the dependencies of the lifting force value and position of the foci of the low aspect ratio (LAR) lifting wing of the above-mentioned design layouts on the angle of attack and flight height are changed by creating, in the longitudinal direction, at least two local zones having different conditions for the generation of lifting forces, the moments of which are mutually compensated for relative to the centre of mass. The local zones are created by substituting the basic LAR wing with at least two LAR wings (one front, one rear) which are mounted in tandem, but with a partial covering in the horizontal plane and with the formation of an air duct therebetween. The lower half of a slipstream from an annular screw propeller (ASP) mounted on the leading edge of the rear LAR wing is directed into the air duct. This ensures an air flow over the entire surface of the rear LAR wing and the sucking off of a layer of air over the entire span of the upper surface of the front LAR wing which smoothly adjoins the internal surface of the ASP ring. Therefore, only the lower surface of the front LAR wing interacts with a free approach stream. This substantially increases the distance between the foci in terms of height and angle of attack and makes it easier to obtain inherent longitudinal static and dynamic stability. The low aspect ratio wings and the ASP form a single structural base group which, together with aerodynamic float-type end plates and additional LAR wings mounted on the upper edges of the end plates, forms the propulsive lifting structure of the WIG craft. Furthermore, cavities for static, dynamic and static/dynamic air cushions are formed under the LAR wing while a region of low air pressure with reduced variation in the longitudinal direction is formed above the entire propulsive lifting structure. Longitudinal balancing and additional controllability are ensured by controlling the front and rear lifting force values by changing the angles of inclination of the flaperons of the LAR wings. Full damping of longitudinal oscillations is ensured with the aid of the automatic control of the front and rear lifting force values, during which the front and rear elevators provided can simultaneously act as angle of attack sensors and as a power drive. By means of the spatial and quantitative configuration of the structural base groups, fuselages, float-type end plates, additional LAR wings, consoles, and stabilizing and steering surfaces, and also the specific structural design thereof, said group of inventions makes it possible to create aircraft having different functional possibilities, in different weight categories. The structural characteristics of the above WIG craft are necessary and sufficient to substantially increase the flight safety with the aid of a method in which, in all of the modes and at all of the heights identified for WIG craft flights, all of the elements and flight stages, including manoeuvres in height, are carried out with a constant pitch angle corresponding to the horizontal position of the fuselage.",NOVIKOV-KOPP IVAN (DE),NOVIKOV-KOPP IVAN (DE),2010-01-05

This transition requires new technologies to reduce the energy required to capture and separate CO2. Here, the present invention discloses a system for capturing carbon dioxide in an aqueous alkaline solution and electrochemically releasing the captured carbon dioxide to a hydrogen-comprising gas stream while simultaneously regenerating the aqueous alkaline solution, said system comprising: a) a contactor unit (8) for bringing air (10) or another carbon dioxide comprising gas stream into contact with the aqueous alkaline solution (12) thereby capturing carbon dioxide by the at least partial transformation of the aqueous alkaline solution (12) into a carbonate and/or bicarbonate comprising solution (14); b) an electrochemical cell (16) comprising an anion-exchange membrane (18) and a cathode compartment (20) and an anode compartment (22), said anion-exchange membrane (20) separating the cathode compartment (20) from the anode compartment (22); c) a first feeder (24) that supplies the carbonate and/or bicarbonate comprising solution (14) to the cathode compartment (20) thereby enabling a hydrogen evolution reaction to take place in order to generate hydroxide ions thus regenerating the aqueous alkaline solution (12) and transporting carbonate anions through the anion-exchange membrane (18) to the anode compartment (22); d) a second feeder (26) that supplies a hydrogen comprising gas stream (28) to the anode compartment (22) thereby providing the anode as hydrogen depolarized anode thus evolving gaseous carbon dioxide; and e) an exhaust gas duct (30) to evacuate the hydrogen depleted and carbon dioxide enriched gas stream (6) from the anode compartment (22) for further processing of the components of the hydrogen depleted and carbon dioxide enriched gas stream (6), preferably of the carbon dioxide content therein. This system and the process executed herewith simultaneously regenerates the CO2 capture solution on the feed side while enriching a stream of H2 with CO2 on the permeate side of the cell. The present results show a high CO2 transport faradaic efficiency when supplying an alkaline solution, such as a pure K2CO3 solution, at current densities up to 60 mA/cm2. A small cathode gap benefites cell operation by preventing membrane transport of OH-, although with an increased ohmic resistance.

Owing to the design of the claimed pure turbojet engine, when an aircraft is flying at supersonic speed, a jet of hot gas which creates reactive thrust is released via a tubular cavity formed by the internal surface of a short section of a pipe of constant diameter, and this, in turn, leads to an increase in turbine power and to a rise in the velocity of the jet of hot gases which create reactive thrust and, as a result, to an increase in engine thrust. Since a nozzle without a three-dimensional regulating structure in the middle is transformed with a reduction in the cross-sectional area thereof, and since some of the passages between vanes of a nozzle apparatus of a first turbine stage are closed, the velocity of the hot gases through the remaining open passages of the nozzle apparatus of the first turbine stage rises and the kinetic energy of said hot gases increases, leading to an increase in the energy which the hot gas transmits to the working vanes of the turbine, thus resulting in an increase in turbine power.",KUDRIASHOV MIKHAIL ANATOLYEVICH (UA),KUDRIASHOV MIKHAIL ANATOLYEVICH (UA),2020-12-28

Therefore, clean combustion is achieved with the FB injection for fuels with distinct properties without fuel preheating or hardware modification. However, in addition to the droplets, the FB injection also produces ligaments for highly viscous liquids and relatively larger droplets at spray edge, resulting in difficulty in sustaining the flame and performs incomplete combustion and higher emissions close to the combustor all. The disclosed swirl burst injector and method utilizes the advantages of FB injection and swirl atomization to further improve atomization, and overcomes the limitations of FB injection, providing a sustainable way to use both conventional and alternative fuels with improved efficiency and minimized emissions.

6210504,US,04/03/2001,Tertiary amine azides in liquid or gel fuels in gas generator systems,"A liquid gas generator system supplies gas pressure only when it is needed. Hydrazine and hydrazine blends have been considered for liquid gas generators because of their ability to decompose at ambient conditions on an iridium catalyst to form warm (1000° F. to 1500° F.) gases. Hydrazine is undesirable because of its toxicity and high melting point (34° F.). The tertiary amine azides, which are defined hereinabove and below, are non-carcinogenic alternatives to hydrazine in liquid or gel gas generator systems. These tertiary amines azides are non-carcinogenic alternatives for use with a thermal reactor bed where exothermic reaction releases enough heat to sustain decomposition for furnishing gases for gas generator systems employed. A tertiary amine typically has three hydrocarbons moieties attached to the nitrogen atom. The tertiary amine azides of this invention can have no more than seven carbon atoms in the molecules. Further, these tertiary amine azides can contain no more than two azide moieties that are attached at the opposite end of the hydrocarbon portions from the amine nitrogen atom. A special case that still meet these requirements is pyrollidine moiety (five atom cyclic structure wherein each end of a linear four carbon atom structure is attached to a common nitrogen atom), and the common nitrogen atom has as attached ethyl azide moiety. A fuel gel propellant fuel that would be a suitable replacement for MMH must be less toxic and have a competitive density impulse for the same engine operating conditions. Three compounds meeting the specified requirements have been synthesized and their physical and chemical properties are evaluated herein as shown in Table 1. The chemical names for these compounds are dimethylaminoethylazide (DMAZ), pyrollidinylethylazide (PYAZ), and bis(ethyazide)methylamine (BAZ). DMAZ has a density of 0.933 and a heat of formation of 580 (cal/g) as compared with MMH having a density of 0.88 and heat of formation of 276 (cal/g).","Thompson, Darren M.

An autopilot system is programmed for rapid descent, in response to a cabin depressurization condition detected by an air pressure sensor, to a flight level where there is sufficient oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain full consciousness. When in the rapid descent mode, the autopilot cuts engine power to idle, reduces the angle of attack, maximizes parasitic drag, and initiates a maximum descent rate without exceeding the aircraft's design limitations. As the aircraft approaches a lower altitude capable of sustaining full human consciousness, the autopilot system increases the angle of attack, reduces parasitic drag, and increases engine power, thereby causing the aircraft to fly level at the lower altitude until the pilot reasserts control of the aircraft.","Fox III, Angus C.

2375222,US,05/08/1945,Aviation lubricating oil,"Compounded lubricating oils contain (1) an oil-miscible metal salt of the condensation product of an aldehyde and a hydrocarbon-substituted aromatic hydroxy compound in which the hydroxyl group is attached to a nuclear carbon atom and which has an unsubstituted position ortho to the hydroxyl group, in an amount sufficient to give high-temperature detergent action in an internal combustion engine, and (2) a minor proportion, generally not exceeding 5 per cent and usually 0.2-0.4 per cent by weight of an oil-soluble anti-oxidant which is an aromatic amine containing at least two benzene rings (other than phenyl-alpha-naphthylamine and tetramethyl - diamino-diphenyl - methane), such of the sulphate ash yielded by the oil as is derived from said salt not exceeding 0.25 per cent based on the oil and being usually 0.04-0.2 per cent.  The substitutent hydrocarbon radicals of the aromatic hydroxy compound and/or the aromatic nucleus may be substituted by chlorine.  The substituents may be alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl groups, such as butyl to decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, octadecylenyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, ethylcyclohexyl, dimethylcyclohexyl, propylcyclohexyl, trimethylcyclohexyl, dicyclohexyl, methylated dicyclohexyl, benzyl or ethylphenyl.  The aromatic nuclus may be mono or dicyclic, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, tetraline or diphenyl.  The aldehyde is preferably formaldehyde or acetaldehyde.  The metal of the salt of the resinous condensation product is preferably an alkaline earth metal but may be another polyvalent metal such as copper, zinc, aluminium, lead, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium or tin. The salt, if difficulty soluble in oil, may be incorporated in oil as described in U.S. Specification 2,042,880 or in many cases may be dissolved in a solvent such as benzene, which may then, while adding oil, be gradually removed by passing an inert gas through the mixture at an elevated temperature.  The concentrate thus obtained may then be diluted with further oil. An example is given of the preparation of the calcium salt of a condensation product of formaldehyde and p-isooctylphenol.  The aromatic amine may contain one or more substituents, such as hydroxyl, chloro, alkoxy, hydroxyalkyl, amino, N-alkylated amino or N-alkylated amino alkylene, radicals.  Preferred anti-oxidants are the naphthylamines, primary, secondary or tertiary aryl or aralkyl amines having at least two aromatic rings, such as phenyl beta-naphthylamine, tetraline naphthylamine, alpha-alpha, alpha-beta or beta-beta dinaphthylamine, various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl naphthylamines, xenyl naphthylamines, benzyl-phenyl naphthylamines, diphenayl - naphthyl - amines, phenyl-xenyl naphthylamines, dixenyl-naphthylamines, and various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl phenyl amines.  In general the N-aryl substituted naphthylamines are preferred.  An example of a naphthylamine which is substituted by a second amino group is 1, 8 diamino naphthalene. Alternatively there may be used diamino diaryl alkanes such as diamino diphenyl methane, tetramethyl diamino triphenyl methane, tetra ethyl diamino triphenyl methane, diamino diphenyl ethane, and diamino ditolyl ethane, or alkylated diaryl amines such as p-ethyl diphenylamine, m-ethyl diphenylamine, p-isopropyl diphenylamine, mono-and polyamyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, hexadecyl, cyclohexyl, methyl cyclohexyl and other alkyl substituted diphenylamine and p-methoxy-p1-isopropyl diphenylamine.  The lubricating oil may also contain oil-soluble salts of bases such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, zinc, cadmium, aluminium, tin, chromium, nickel and cobalt (and of organic bases including primary, secondary, or tertiary amino and quaternary ammonium compounds) combined with such organic acids as fatty acids of 10-30 carbon atoms, wool fat acids, acids produced by oxidation of paraffin wax, chlorinated fatty acids, rosin acids, fatty and hydroxy fatty acids containing aromatic constituents, aromatic carboxylic acids including paraffin wax benzoic acids, alkyl salicylic acids, phthalic acid mono-esters, aromatic keto of ether acids, diphenols such as di(alkylphenol) sulphides and disulphides, sulphonic acids derived from alkyl aryl hydrocarbons or from high boiling petroleum oils, sulphuric acid mono-esters; phosphoric, arsenic and antimonic acid mono- and diesters, including mono- and di-esters of the corresponding thiophosphoric, thio arsenic and thio antimonic acids, phosphonic and arsonic acids.  Examples of these auxiliary detergents are the alkaline earth phosphate and thiophosphate di-esters and the alkaline earth diphenolates, specifically the calcium and barium salts of diphenol mono and polysulphides.  The calcium salts of oil-soluble petroleum sulphonic acid are said to be particularly advantageous.  Other auxiliary additives may include phosphatides such as lecithin, fatty oils such as rape oil, and voltolized fatty or mineral oils.  Anti-rusting compounds such as dicarboxylic acids of 16 or more carbon atoms or organic compounds containing an acidic radical very near to a nitrile, nitro or nitroso group (e.g. alpha cyano stearic acid) and alkali metal salts of sulphonic acids or fatty acids may also be present. Other additives such as blooming agents, pour-point depressants, viscosity improvers, auxiliary anti-oxidants, extreme pressure agents and anti-foaming agents may be present.  Examples of auxiliary anti-oxidants are alkyl phenols such as 2, 4, 6-trimethylphenol, pentamethylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-tertiary-butylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-octylphenol, 2, 6-ditertiary-butyl-4-methylphenol, and 2, 4, 6-tritertiary-butylphenol.

The lighter non-combustible component (Nitrogen) exits from the turbine in one direction for storage in the Inert gas tank. The heavier (Argon) and medium (Oxygen) components together move in the opposite direction for having a second stratifying separation downstream in the vortex tube, to separate non-combustible, heavier (Argon) gas from combustible medium (Oxygen) gas components. The combustible, medium (Oxygen) component exits the vortex tube open end, to flow into an Oxygenating storage tank; whereas, the heavier, non-combustible(Argon) gas is piped into the Inert gas storage tank. Both gas storage tank in-flow lines are fitted with non-return valves. The out flow lines from the Inert tank to either Fuel Tank “Ullage” or “OBGIS” areas are fitted with electronic control valves, operated by signals received from fibre-optic Temperature/Pressure/Oxygen concentration Sensors in the Fuel tank “Ullage” or “OBGIS: areas.

The dosing units can be used with devices made to contact diesel fuel. In one approach, a catalytic metal additive concentrate (CMAC) is prepared in normally solid, semisolid or viscous form. The CMAC will preferably be encapsulated with a solid polymer. The encapsulation can be accomplished by embedding or dispersing the CMAC in a suitable polymer. If desired, the CMAC can be dispersed in one polymer and then the resulting composite can be embedded in the same or a different polymer. In an alternative form, a dosing unit can comprise a semisolid CMAC, which could be similarly held in contact with flowing fuel.","Sprague, Barry N. (Bethlehem, CT, US)

These radicals attack fresh methane, forming stable methane-sulfonic acid (MSA) while creating new methyl radicals to sustain a chain reaction. This system avoids the use or creation of water, and liquid MSA is an amphoteric solvent that increases the solubility and reactivity of methane and SO3. MSA from this process can be sold or used as a valuable chemical with no mercaptan or halogen impurities, or it can be processed to convert it into methanol, dimethyl ether, or other fuels or liquid products.

The smart projectiles stabilize themselves in space using a system of on board thrusters operated by computers. Laser beams and radio transmissions are directed at the spaceship and are monitored by sensors aboard the spaceship. Computers on board the spaceship determine any necessary course corrections for the projectiles based upon the spaceship's sensor system. Appropriate commands are radioed to the projectiles which execute the commanded maneuvers to alter their trajectories. The spaceship carries a second EMPL and a nuclear-powered electricity generating facility to provide electricity to operate the EMPL. The spaceship, the second EMPL and the nuclear power facility are all rotated axially about the long axis of the EMPL to provide both gyroscopic stabilization and also artifical gravity for the crew of the spaceship. The second EMPL is used to catch the projectiles which transfers the momentum of the projectiles to the spaceship thereby accelerating it in the desired direction. Additional acceleration of the spaceship is achieved by again launching the captured projectiles in a direction opposite to the desired direction of motion of the spaceship. The spaceship can be decelerated in a similar manner. Mars can be reached in two months using this system.","Willis, Robert C. (Bangor, PA)",WILLIS; ROBERT C.,07/23/1991

In addition, the represented group of inventions is made up of two more inventions: Maintenance System of ATNPP, (MS ATNPP) and Emergency Response System of NATSK, (ERS NATSK).
The concept of practical implementation of the presented group of inventions involves the fact that ATNPP, which is a large unmanned drone aircraft “Tiagach”, supplies the aero-train composed of a number of passenger liners and cargo transport planes using electric motors with traction electric energy in the air.
The power supply of such an aero-train is based on the onboard Nuclear Power Plant of the aircraft “Tiagach”. In this case, the transmission of electric power to the towed electric aircraft of the aero-train is carried out by means of electric split feeders and cables, connecting and disconnecting of which between airplanes of the aero-train is carried out in the air, by analogy with refueling of airplanes in the air with JP fuel.
During the flight of the aero-train on a logistically optimized route, electric airplanes can detach from and attach to the aero-train, taking off and landing along the flight route of the aero-train using their own electric accumulators. In addition, extra ATNPP may be included in the aero-train during its flight, if it is necessary to increase the thrust. At the same time, due to the use of nuclear power, such ATNPP can remain in the air for a conditionally indefinite period of time.
The invention is aimed at creating cost-effective air freight and passenger traffic.","Sevastyanov, Vladimir Petrovich (Novosibirsk, RU)

7067456,US,06/27/2006,Sorbent for separation of carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas mixtures,"A reaction-based process has been developed for the selective removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from a multicomponent gas mixture to provide a gaseous stream depleted in CO2 compared to the inlet CO2 concentration in the stream. The proposed process effects the separation of CO2 from a mixture of gases (such as flue gas/fuel gas) by its reaction with metal oxides (such as calcium oxide). The Calcium based Reaction Separation for CO2 (CaRS-CO2) process consists of contacting a CO2 laden gas with calcium oxide (CaO) in a reactor such that CaO captures the CO2 by the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Once “spent”, CaCO3 is regenerated by its calcination leading to the formation of fresh CaO sorbent and the evolution of a concentrated stream of CO2. The “regenerated” CaO is then recycled for the further capture of more CO2. This carbonation-calcination cycle forms the basis of the CaRS-CO2 process. This process also identifies the application of a mesoporous CaCO3 structure, developed by a process detailed elsewhere, that attains >90% conversion over multiple carbonation and calcination cycles. Lastly, thermal regeneration (calcination) under vacuum provided a better sorbent structure that maintained reproducible reactivity levels over multiple cycles.","Fan, Liang-shih (Columbus, OH, US)

Preferred anti-oxidants are the naphthylamines, primary, secondary or tertiary aryl or aralkyl amines having at least two aromatic rings, such as phenyl beta-naphthylamine, tetraline naphthylamine, alpha-alpha, alpha-beta or beta-beta dinaphthylamine, various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl naphthylamines, xenyl naphthylamines, benzyl-phenyl naphthylamines, diphenayl - naphthyl - amines, phenyl-xenyl naphthylamines, dixenyl-naphthylamines, and various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl phenyl amines.  In general the N-aryl substituted naphthylamines are preferred.  An example of a naphthylamine which is substituted by a second amino group is 1, 8 diamino naphthalene. Alternatively there may be used diamino diaryl alkanes such as diamino diphenyl methane, tetramethyl diamino triphenyl methane, tetra ethyl diamino triphenyl methane, diamino diphenyl ethane, and diamino ditolyl ethane, or alkylated diaryl amines such as p-ethyl diphenylamine, m-ethyl diphenylamine, p-isopropyl diphenylamine, mono-and polyamyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, hexadecyl, cyclohexyl, methyl cyclohexyl and other alkyl substituted diphenylamine and p-methoxy-p1-isopropyl diphenylamine.  The lubricating oil may also contain oil-soluble salts of bases such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, zinc, cadmium, aluminium, tin, chromium, nickel and cobalt (and of organic bases including primary, secondary, or tertiary amino and quaternary ammonium compounds) combined with such organic acids as fatty acids of 10-30 carbon atoms, wool fat acids, acids produced by oxidation of paraffin wax, chlorinated fatty acids, rosin acids, fatty and hydroxy fatty acids containing aromatic constituents, aromatic carboxylic acids including paraffin wax benzoic acids, alkyl salicylic acids, phthalic acid mono-esters, aromatic keto of ether acids, diphenols such as di(alkylphenol) sulphides and disulphides, sulphonic acids derived from alkyl aryl hydrocarbons or from high boiling petroleum oils, sulphuric acid mono-esters; phosphoric, arsenic and antimonic acid mono- and diesters, including mono- and di-esters of the corresponding thiophosphoric, thio arsenic and thio antimonic acids, phosphonic and arsonic acids.  Examples of these auxiliary detergents are the alkaline earth phosphate and thiophosphate di-esters and the alkaline earth diphenolates, specifically the calcium and barium salts of diphenol mono and polysulphides.  The calcium salts of oil-soluble petroleum sulphonic acid are said to be particularly advantageous.  Other auxiliary additives may include phosphatides such as lecithin, fatty oils such as rape oil, and voltolized fatty or mineral oils.  Anti-rusting compounds such as dicarboxylic acids of 16 or more carbon atoms or organic compounds containing an acidic radical very near to a nitrile, nitro or nitroso group (e.g. alpha cyano stearic acid) and alkali metal salts of sulphonic acids or fatty acids may also be present. Other additives such as blooming agents, pour-point depressants, viscosity improvers, auxiliary anti-oxidants, extreme pressure agents and anti-foaming agents may be present.  Examples of auxiliary anti-oxidants are alkyl phenols such as 2, 4, 6-trimethylphenol, pentamethylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-tertiary-butylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-octylphenol, 2, 6-ditertiary-butyl-4-methylphenol, and 2, 4, 6-tritertiary-butylphenol.  The compounded lubricating oil is especially suitable for use in aviation engines.","Griffin Jr., John R.

This inflated surface is then used as a guide for constructing the hull of the structure by wrapping the surface with long sheets of high strength material until the desired wall thickness and rigidity is obtained. The wrapping process is accomplished automatically by a wrapping machine. Since the inflatable surface can be packaged into a small volume, and since the sheets of wrapping material can be rolled into spools with very high packing density, it is possible to construct large continuous-walled pressurized structures in orbit using robotics with relatively few Shuttle flights. The method is used to construct a large permanently manned orbiting space station that provides an artificial gravity environment for the living quarters and connecting variable gravity environments for research and materials processing.

The release of high pressure, low temperature oxygen exclusion gases penetrate the fire from above, chills the substrate and extinguishes the fire. As carbon dioxide is heavier than air it hangs as a cloud over the extinguished substratum effectively preventing reignition.

The mechanical radius of curvature is preferably less than 50% of the aerodynamic radius of curvature during hypersonic operation. Preferably the mechanical radius of curvature is the smallest allowed by the fabrication method (i.e., a knife edge), such as being less than about 0.02 inches, preferably less than about 0.01 inches. The transpiration blowing rate can be adjusted so that the blowing rate and aerodynamic radius of curvature are relatively low except during periods of maximum heat flux, such as the shock-on-lip point. Since the mechanical radius of curvature is effectively zero, control of the aerodynamic radius of curvature provides complete control of peak heat flux. By adjusting blowing rate to the minimum necessary at any given velocity, transpiration consumption, drag and fuel injection are reduced or eliminated.","Bulman, Melvin J.

The manufacture of the materials relies on the control of deposition temperature and in-vacuum consolidation during vapor deposition, on maximized heat transfer or casting pressure during all-liquid processing and on controlled friction and shock power during solid state alloying using a mechanical milling technique. The alloy synthesis is followed by extrusion, rolling, forging, drawing and superplastic forming for which the conditions of mechanical working, thermal exposure and time to transfer corresponding metastable α′-matrix phases and microstructure into product form depend on thermal stability and transformation behavior at higher temperatures of said light alloy as well as on the defects inherent to a specific alloy synthesis employed. Alloying additions to the resulting α′-monophase matrix include 0.1 to 40 wt. % metalloids or light rare earth or early transition or simple or heavy rare earth metals or a combination thereof. The eventually more complex light alloys are designed to retain the low density and to improve damage tolerance of corresponding base metals and may include an artificial aging upon thermomechanical processing with or without solid solution heat and quench and annealing treatment for a controlled volume fraction and size of solid state precipitates to reinforce alloy film, layer or bulk and resulting surface qualities.

6205763,US,03/27/2001,Method of forming a swirler with as-cast holes,"A method for determining the appropriate hole parameters to achieve the desired airflow in a swirler with as-cast air jet holes includes the steps of determining the desired airflow through the holes and selecting a hole angle for the holes. Next, the ratio of the hole exit area to the hole inlet area is calculated based on the desired airflow and the selected hole angle using a regression equation. Then a value is determined for either of the hole exit area or the hole inlet area, and the other area is calculated from the known ratio. Once the hole angle, hole exit area and hole inlet area have been determined, then a swirler can be cast with as-cast holes using these hole parameters.","Farmer, Gilbert (Cincinnati, OH)
