Amine azides decompose on an iridium catalyst at 400° F. and have very low freezing points (<-65° F.). Dimethylaminoethylazide (DMAZ) has been tested and is a suitable replacement for hydrazine in monopropellant thruster applications. An amine azide can be used as a non-carcinogenic alternative for any monopropellant system using hydrazine. An amine azide could be used to replace hydrazine in thrust vector control or reactive control applications for space based applications. An amine azide could be used to replace hydrazine in divert attitude control systems in interceptor missile systems. In a gel fuel formulation the tertiary amine azide gel can have 0.5%-10% gellant. The gellant can be silicon dioxide, clay, carbon or any polymeric gellant. The amine azide gel can also include additives that could improve the specific impulse and density impulse. These solid additives include but would not be limited to amine-nitrate salts, quaternary ammonium salts or other high-density additives. The formulation can vary over the following ranges 1%-90% solid additive, 100%-10% tertiary amine azide and 0.5%-10% gellant.","Thompson, Darren M.
