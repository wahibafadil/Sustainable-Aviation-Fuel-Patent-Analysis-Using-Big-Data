This transition requires new technologies to reduce the energy required to capture and separate CO2.Here, the present invention discloses a system for capturing carbon dioxide in an aqueous alkaline solution and electrochemically releasing the captured carbon dioxide to a hydrogen-comprising gas stream while simultaneously regenerating the aqueous alkaline solution, said system comprising:
a) a contactor unit (8) for bringing air (10) or another carbon dioxide comprising gas stream into contact with the aqueous alkaline solution (12) thereby capturing carbon dioxide by the at least partial transformation of the aqueous alkaline solution (12) into a carbonate and/or bicarbonate comprising solution (14);
b) an electrochemical cell (16) comprising an anion-exchange membrane (18) and a cathode compartment (20) and an anode compartment (22), said anion-exchange membrane (20) separating the cathode compartment (20) from the anode compartment (22);
c) a first feeder (24) that supplies the carbonate and/or bicarbonate comprising solution (14) to the cathode compartment (20) thereby enabling a hydrogen evolution reaction to take place in order to generate hydroxide ions thus regenerating the aqueous alkaline solution (12) and transporting carbonate anions through the anion-exchange membrane (18) to the anode compartment (22);
d) a second feeder (26) that supplies a hydrogen comprising gas stream (28) to the anode compartment (22) thereby providing the anode as hydrogen depolarized anode thus evolving gaseous carbon dioxide; and
e) an exhaust gas duct (30) to evacuate the hydrogen depleted and carbon dioxide enriched gas stream (6) from the anode compartment (22) for further processing of the components of the hydrogen depleted and carbon dioxide enriched gas stream (6), preferably of the carbon dioxide content therein.This system and the process executed herewith simultaneously regenerates the CO2 capture solution on the feed side while enriching a stream of H2 with CO2 on the permeate side of the cell. The present results show a high CO2 transport faradaic efficiency when supplying an alkaline solution, such as a pure K2CO3 solution, at current densities up to 60 mA/cm2. A small cathode gap benefites cell operation by preventing membrane transport of OH-, although with an increased ohmic resistance. This represents a step forward in the application of electrochemistry to drive processes that are critical to CO2 valorization.

The uncorrected signal appears at the output of 57 and is filtered at 59 and integrated at 60, the output of which is said to be the desired, corrected signal. This is fed back as shown for subtraction at 58 from the uncorrected signal, the output of 58 thus being the dynamic weight errors signal only. This is in turn fed back on line 63 to correct that portion of the computer 49' which calculates the actual coefficient of lift C/L, and this is the subject of the main claim. The amount of feedback used is determined by KW and is set to allow for slow changes e.g. due to fuel consumption. The signal W is the weight supported by the wings; during take off this varies rapidly so at this time an alternative filter 59', having a short time constant, is switched in. The switch, 204, is controlled by a lift off detector 26 which responds to the tilt angle #, measured by a gyroscope.

The nose fairing of the body is made up of movable thermally-protected panels, namely a bottom panel with a heat-resistant nose cone and (nominally) two top panels. If a reusable propulsion and instrumentation module of a second stage launch vehicle is converted into a space plane, then the panels cover the nozzle (or two nozzles) of the main rocket assembly in the reentry configuration. If the space plane is a reusable module from a space transportation vehicle, then the nose fairing panels cover the docking assembly in the insertion and reentry stages. When a reusable propulsion and instrumentation module is in the launch configuration, the wing panels are tented over the upper part of the body of the space plane, and the displaced top panels of the nose fairing lie compactly on them. The bottom panel of the fairing is also displaced and lies compactly against the underside of the middle part of the body of the space plane.

DE3226070A1,DE,1983-04-21,LUFTFAHRZEUG UND ANORDNUNGEN DAFUER,"A rotor having airfoil-section shaped blades is set into a fluid stream. Over a connection-or-transmission means a propeller is connected to the rotor. The fluid stream whereinto the rotor is set gives airflow energy to the rotor and revolves the rotor. The propeller is driven by the rotor over the connection-or transmission means. Since the propeller is revolved by the rotor in the fluid stream, the propeller provides a thrust. The thrust may be used to lift a weight or to drive a member. A suitable application of the arrangement is for example, to transform a multi-bladed helicopter into a gliding craft which descends under a gliding angle towards the surface of the earth, when the helicopter has a complete engine failure. Auto-rotation accidents can thereby become prevented. The device is also applicable to drive a vehicle or to lift a weight.

Dabei werden in einer Brennkammer die Schadstoffe in neutrale Verbrennungsprodukte umgewandelt und als Bestandteil der Abgase in die Umgebung ausgeleitet. Durch Einsatz von Luftvorwärmern wird der zusätzliche Brennstoffenergiebedarf verringert. Das gereinigte Gas verlässt die Brennkammer je nach Einsatzfall mit Temperaturen zwischen 750 und 1.200°C und wird anschließend in einem Luftvorwärmer zwecks Vorwärmung des Rohgases abgekühlt. Die verbleibende Wärme im Abgas kann in Abhitzekesseln aufgenommen werden. Meist ist jedoch eine Verwendung der Wärme nicht möglich. Daher wurde versucht, die hochtemperierte Wärme der Abgase mittels Dampfkraft- oder ORC-Anlagen in elektrische Energie umzuwandeln und damit die Effizienz des Systems zu verbessern. Dies scheitert aber stets daran, dass sowohl Dampfkraft- als auch ORC-Anlagen keine ausreichende Effizienz aufweisen und ihre Installation mit einem sehr hohen, nicht vertretbaren technischen Aufwand verbunden wäre. Ein wesentlicher Grund hierfür ist, dass in diesen Anlagen geschlossene Prozesse mit z. T. sehr hohen Drücken angewendet werden müssen. Die hier vorgeschlagene Lösung basiert auf einem offenen Joule-Prozess, der drucklos und im Unterdruck betrieben wird. Durch das begrenzte Druckniveau wird auch bei kleinen Anlagen eine hohe Effizienz ermöglicht. Die Verwendung von preiswerten Serienprodukten aus der Motorenindustrie ermöglicht die Ausführung der Systeme als Mehrwellenanlagen und damit auch zusätzliche Prozessverbesserungen, die weder in Dampfkraft- noch in ORC-Anlagen realisiert werden können.

An advantage of the present invention is the increased safety the pre-ignition prevention sub-system provides to the engine by significantly reducing the likelihood that fuel/air mixture within a cylinder will be ignited prematurely.,HILLSBERG MITCHELL C; ROTHMAN PAUL J,UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP (US),1995-07-26

The high inlet temperature allows a high conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. Various fuels can be used including hydrogen, hydrocarbons, oxygenates, or carbon monoxide can be used as combustion fuel. The carbon monoxide produced can further be reacted with hydrogen to produce hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals. The hydrocarbon fuels produced include sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets ASTM D7566 specification and diesel fuel that meets ASTM D975 specification. The hydrogen and oxygen are produced from the electrolysis of water. The carbon dioxide can be captured from industrial point sources such as power plants, ethanol plants, steel mills, or other producers of carbon dioxide.

The structured biochar acts as a nucleation agent for the algae in the PBR, as a absorption agent to absorb inorganics from the biomass feed to direct liquefaction or from the liquids produced thereby, and as a water retention agent in the biofertilizer. The ratio of cyanobacteria to diazotrophic microorganisms in the biofertilizer can be selected to optimize the so as to achieve desired total chemically active carbon and nitrogen contents in the soil for a given crop.","Fiato, Rocco A.

These strategically located and cryogenically stored devices are launched at the outbreak of fire, aerially or terrestrially over a blaze. An embedded explosive charge is detonated at a predetermined and optimum height causing the solidified gases/compacted solid extinguishing agents to be dispersed instantaneously and forcefully over targeted and specified areas. The release of high pressure, low temperature oxygen exclusion gases penetrate the fire from above, chills the substrate and extinguishes the fire. As carbon dioxide is heavier than air it hangs as a cloud over the extinguished substratum effectively preventing reignition. Fly ash, fine quarry dust or any solid or semisolid extinguishing agent can also be made to disperse under force over the fires in the same mode which cuts off the oxygen supply to the burning substrates.
