9534560,US,01/03/2017,Heat engine,"A non-compression engine having two or three variable volume mechanisms, an induction-displacer (1) and a combustion-expander (2) or an induction-displacer (1) and a combustion-expander (2) and an atmospheric-cooler (3). A working volume of gas is drawn into the induction-displacer, then displaced into the combustion-expander (2) at substantially constant volume passing through the regenerator (5). The gas in the combustor-expander (2) is further heated by combustion of a fuel then expanded to extract work. The gas is then displaced through the regenerator (5) into the atmospheric-cooler (3) at substantially constant volume, or exhaust from the regenerator at constant pressure. The gas is contracted in the atmospheric-cooler doing atmospheric work. Once the gas has equilibrated with the pressure of the atmosphere it is exhaust from the atmospheric-cooler (3).","Coates, Nicholas Richard (East Sussex, GB)",2020 POWER GENERATION LIMITED (GB),10/25/2010
11298063,US,04/12/2022,Hydrogen powered device,"A system and method to handle urine includes collecting urine using a pad or garment, exposing the urine to an aluminum alloy to generate hydrogen gas and heat in an exothermic reaction, and storing the hydrogen in a sealed chamber.","Tran, Bao Q.

6092365,US,07/25/2000,Heat engine,"A heat engine is optimized for maximum efficiency for use as an automotive powerplant. The engine is composed of a separate variable induction compressor, a compressed air accumulator, a combustor, and a separate expander. The engine is designed to minimize heat losses following compression, minimize system parasitic losses, and utilize high combustion temperatures. The expander is constructed to minimize mechanical stresses and facilitate the use of structural ceramic materials.","Leidel, James A. (Brownstown Township, MI)",LEIDEL; JAMES A.,02/23/1998
US20060088332,US,04/27/2006,Oxygen generators in ink cartridge environment,"A system is provided within an electrophotographic imaging environment that removes or decomposes airborne hydrocarbons (as vapor and/or droplets), at least some of which are provided from evaporation or airborne dispersal of hydrocarbon carrier from electrophotographic toners or inks during and imaging process. The system comprises a catalyst that assists in the oxidation or decomposition of hydrocarbons and a (catalyst and vapor phase) heating and oxygen-providing components comprising an chemical oxygen-generator. The chemical reaction that occurs in the oxygen generation provides both a) immediate and significant amounts of heat that heats both the catalyst and the gas phase containing the hydrocarbon and the oxygen and b) oxygen to assist in the decomposition and/or oxidation of the hydrocarbon and other airborne materials.","Brenner, Robert E.
