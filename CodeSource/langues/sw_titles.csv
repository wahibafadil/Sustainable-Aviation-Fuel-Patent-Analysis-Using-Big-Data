A micromachine of the invention has a rotor disk journalled for rotation in a stationary structure by a journal bearing. A plurality of radial flow rotor blades, substantially untapered in height, are disposed on a first rotor disk face, and an electrically conducting region is disposed on a rotor disk face. A plurality of stator electrodes that are electrically interconnected to define multiple electrical stator phases are disposed on a wall of the stationary structure located opposite the electrically conducting region of the rotor disk. A first orifice in the stationary structure provides fluidic communication with the first rotor disk face at a location radially central of the rotor blades, and a second orifice in the stationary structure provides fluidic communication with the first rotor disk face at a location radially peripheral of the rotor blades. An electrical connection to the stator electrode configuration is provided for stator electrode excitation and for power transfer with the stator electrode configuration as the rotor disk rotates.",EPSTEIN ALAN H (US); SENTURIA STEPHEN D (US); WAITZ IAN A (US); LANG JEFFREY H (US); JACOBSON STUART A (US); EHRICH FREDRIC F (US); SCHMIDT MARTIN A (US); ANANTHASURESH G K (US); SPEARING MARK S (US); BREUER KENNETH S (US); NAGLE STEVEN F (US),"MASSACHUSETTS INST TECHNOLOGY (Cambridge, MA 02139, US)",1997-07-14
WO/1998/002643A1,WIPO,1998-01-22,MICROTURBOMACHINERY,"The invention provides a micro-gas turbine engine and associated microcomponentry. The engine components, including, e.g., a compressor, a diffuser having diffuser vanes, a combustion chamber, turbine guide vanes, and a turbine are each manufactured by, e.g., microfabrication techniques, of a structural material that can be common to all of the elements, e.g., a microelectronic material such as silicon or silicon carbide. Vapor deposition techniques, as well as bulk wafer etching techniques, can be employed to produce the engine. The engine includes a rotor having a shaft with a substantially untapered compressor disk on a first end, defining a centrifugal compressor, and a substantially untapered turbine disk on the opposite end, defining a radial inflow turbine. The rotor is preferably formed of a material characterized by a strength-to-density ratio that enables a rotor speed of at least about 500,000 rotations per minute. An annular, axial-flow combustion chamber is provided that is located axially between the compressor and turbine disks and that has a ratio of annular height to axial length of at least about 0.5. The micro-gas turbine engine can be configured with an integral microgenerator as a source of electrical power, and can be employed for a wide range of power, propulsion, and thermodynamic cycle applications.",EPSTEIN ALAN H; SENTURIA STEPHEN D; WAITZ IAN A; LANG JEFFREY H; JACOBSON STUART A; EHRICH FREDRIC F; SCHMIDT MARTIN A; ANANTHASURESH G K; SPEARING MARK S; BREUER KENNETH S; NAGLE STEVEN F,MASSACHUSETTS INST TECHNOLOGY (US),1997-07-14
