11585282,US,02/21/2023,Fuel characteristics,A method of identifying a fuel contained in a fuel tank of an aircraft and arranged to power a gas turbine engine of the aircraft is performed by processing circuitry of the aircraft and includes: obtaining at least one fuel characteristic of any fuel already present in the fuel tank prior to refuelling; determining at least one fuel characteristic of a fuel added to the fuel tank on refuelling; and calculating at least one fuel characteristic of the resultant fuel in the fuel tank after refuelling. The method may further controlling the propulsion system of the aircraft based on the calculated at least one fuel characteristic of the resultant fuel in the fuel tank after refuelling.,"Swann, Peter (Derby, GB)

4059247,US,11/22/1977,Convertiblade,"An aircraft which operates between the surface and the air as a rotating wing aircraft (helicopter-autogiro). When airborne a rotor pylon latch is released and the pilot flies the rotor system aft about its pivot to the fuselage to form the tail of a high speed jet propelled airplane. Altering the pitch angle of the blades controls the aircraft, called a convertiblade, for helicopter-autogiro and airplane configurations and for moving the rotor between its configurations. The rotor is revved up with rocket fuel piped to burner jet nozzles located at the blade tips. A jump-take-off may be used to efficiently get the convertiblade airborne at a good climbing speed. Prior to landing, the rotor blades are released from their operation as roll control surfaces for the airplane configuration; then, they are permitted to rev-up and act as a brake to reduce the speed of the airplane. At a suitable speed, the pylon is released from the fuselage and the rotor system is flown by the pilot's controls up into autogiro configuration where it automatically latches permitting the pilot to make a flared autogiro landing. The transition between autogiro and airplane takes place in a very short period of time. The fuselage is kept stable during the transitions by the pilot's controls and by establishing lateral, directional, and longitudinal stability through relationships between the center of gravity and the center of all fin-areas of the aircraft for each regime of flight. Several methods of augmenting the rotor controls during transition are presented including the use of combined wing tip elevators and ailerons.","Prewitt, Richard H.

4097820,US,06/27/1978,Lasers,"A laser resonator is combined with a circuitous detonation channel to which is fed a suitable explosive gas mixture. The gas mixture is ignited, thereby creating travelling detonation waves which are maintained in circulation around the detonation channel. A population inversion is produced in the detonation product by exhausting the products via a convergent-divergent supersonic expansion nozzle. The products then pass through the laser resonator. At least one substantially linear portion is formed in a detonation channel circuit with the supersonic expansion nozzle being formed in this section of the detonation channel. The optical axis of the laser resonator is oriented to be substantially parallel to a slit nozzle which forms the supersonic expansion nozzle to thereby achieve a large ratio of active length to diameter of the laser resonator.","Hill, Roland John (Quarndon, EN)
