EP0447215A3,EP,1992-05-06,GENERATOR AUXILIARY MODE LUBRICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD,"Abstract of EP0447215A generator system having a failure mode cooling-oil lubricating auxiliary compartment [Figs. 1-4 (44)] structurally integrated into the generator casing (14) so as to provide a supplement to primary [Fig. 1 (100, 110); Fig. 3 (112-118)] cooling and lubrication functions. A coupled driving unit (20) and generating unit (10) of an aircraft generating system has primary pump (50) cooling and lubricating functions during productive rotating electrical power generation (AC), and cooling friction and windage cooling function and a residual lubrication function [Figs. 1, 2, 4 (142-148)] is used for critical rotating components, during a fault mode of electrical non-power output production in the generator. This is provided in order to retard or eliminate damage and destruction of the coupled driving and generator units during an extended interim without power output of a failed generator unit, such as when its primary cooling and lubricating components have ceased to function.","MCCABRIA, JACK LEE",WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORPORATION,1991-03-13
