JPH06312700A,JP,1994-11-08,CONTROL DISPLAY SYSTEM,"PURPOSE: To provide a display screen, by which optimum display to a pilot can be made, and the flying condition of a pilotless aircraft can be understood and judged easily and precisely by the pilot by collectively displaying various kinds of flying data on a special-purpose control display, and providing a function capable of changing the display screen so as to be suitable for the pilot. CONSTITUTION: Plural pilotless aircrafts 11a-11n are loaded with telemeter signal transmitters 9a-9n, and control signal receivers 10a-10n, and on the other hand, a control display system special for each aircraft is provided on the ground side. Various kinds of flying data transmitted from the pilotless aircrafts 1a-11n is collectively displayed on one screen of the control display 1a-1n, and the display screen of the control display 1a-1n is changed depending on pilots 4a-4n, or switched to be displayed in scroll or dividing method.COPYRIGHT: (C)1994,JPO",YOKOTA KOICHI,JAPAN AVIATION ELECTRON,1993-04-28
US20230332548,US,10/19/2023,FUEL DELIVERY,"A gas turbine engine for an aircraft includes a staged combustion system having pilot fuel injectors and main fuel injectors. The gas turbine engine further includes a fuel delivery regulator arranged to control delivery of fuel to the pilot and main fuel injectors, and a fuel characteristic determination module configured to determine one or more fuel characteristics of the fuel being supplied to the staged combustion system. A controller is configured to determine a staging point defining the point at which the staged combustion system is switched between pilot-only operation and pilot-and-main operation, the staging point being determined based on the determined one or more fuel characteristics, the controller being configured to control the staged combustion system according to the determined staging point.","Swann, Peter (Derby, GB)

The combustion chamber is configured to receive a pressurized air stream from the compressor. Further, fuel is injected into the pressurized air in the combustion chamber and ignited so as to raise a temperature and energy level of the pressurized air. The turbine is operatively coupled to the combustion chamber so as to receive combustion products that flow from the combustion chamber. The generator is coupled to the turbine via a shaft. Thus, the torsional damper is configured to dampen torsional oscillations of the generator. Moreover, the controller is configured to provide additional damping control to the generator.","Gemin, Paul Robert (Cincinnati, OH, US)
