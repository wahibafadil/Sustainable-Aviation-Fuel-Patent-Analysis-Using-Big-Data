Heat transfers to reformers (10) which may be incrementally shielded packed beds (30, 60) of the reactors (18, 19) of the reformer (10) by radiation from the stacks (14), furnace wall (38), or both and by forced convection from the exhausting airflow exiting the stack furnace (12). Temperature gradients in the reformer (10) may be controlled by selective (or incremented) radiation shielding (20) and by counterflow heat exchange to prevent excessive premature cracking in the reformer. Such an optimized design uses a minimum amount of catalyst, yet prevents carbonization from clogging interstices or otherwise rendering the catalyst or catalyst granules (32) ineffective. Alternatively sufficient catalyst may be provided to render the reformation process a heat-limited reaction. In this circumstance, the stacks (132) configured in a module (106) may transfer heat directly to a reformer (110) surrounding the module (106). The air may pass through a heat exchanger 108 or preheater (200) positioned proximate the module 106 in an insulated enclosure (102).","Khandkar, Ashok C. (Salt Lake City, UT)

4739957,US,04/26/1988,Strake fence flap,"The strake fence flap is a device which may be tailored to the aircraft to augment the low-speed lift of canard-configured general aviation aircraft with little or no longitudinal trim change and no cruise drag penalty. The strake fence flap is deployed along the upper surface of each of the strakes on the canard aircraft. The strake fence flap is hinged along its lower edge which allows it to be retracted and extended as needed. In the cruise configuration, the strake fence flap is folded flush with the strake upper surface. For deceleration or landing where increased lift and drag are required, the strake fence flap is extended. The frontal area of the strake fence flap becomes exposed resulting in additional drag. The geometry and positioning of the fence causes the flow to separate from the upper edge of the fence and to roll up into a vortex which trails over the strake. The intense suction which accompanies the vortex acts directly on the strake upper surface, thereby significantly increasing the lift.","Vess, Robert J. (Raleigh, NC)
