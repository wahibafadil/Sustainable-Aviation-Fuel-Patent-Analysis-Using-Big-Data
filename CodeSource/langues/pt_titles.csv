EP3978728A1,EP,2022-04-06,AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION BASED ON ENGINE PERFORMANCE MONITORING,"A system (400) and method (420) for optimizing performance of an aircraft (100) or boat through detection and trending of engine deterioration based on the performance of the vehicle's gas turbine engine (200).The system and method detects declines in engine power due to either of in-transit events or over the extended lifetime of the engine, the declines being due to routine engine part aging or an event. As engine power gradually or suddenly deteriorates, the system (400) and method (420) lowers a maximum operating line which defines the safe limits for peak engine power consumption during flight. For in-transit events, the system and method detects when actual power consumption (502) is approaching the current maximum operating line. The controller (110) may then automate changes to operations of entirely separate aircraft systems, such as rebalancing electrical energy consumption by various non-engine elements of the aircraft (100).

The method includes the steps of energizing heater elements on at least one of the guide vanes, de-energizing heater elements on at least one of the guide vanes, and energizing heater elements on at least one of the guide vanes which was not energized in the first energizing step.","Edmondson, Wayne Garcia (West Chester, OH, US)",Assignee not found,06/30/2009
US20220097864,US,03/31/2022,AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION BASED ON ENGINE PERFORMANCE MONITORING,"A system and method for optimizing performance of an aircraft or boat through detection and trending of engine deterioration based on the performance of the vehicle's gas turbine. The system and method detects declines in engine power due to either of in-transit events or over the extended lifetime of the engine, the declines being due to routine engine part aging or an event. As engine power gradually or suddenly deteriorates, the system and method lowers a maximum operating line which defines the safe limits for peak engine power consumption during flight. For in-transit events, the system and method detects when actual power consumption is approaching the current maximum operating line. The controller may then automate changes to operations of entirely separate aircraft systems, such as rebalancing electrical energy consumption by various non-engine elements of the aircraft.","Baladi, Mehdi M.

10539073,US,01/21/2020,Centrifugal gas compressor,"This invention performs the gas pressurization task of a centrifugal compressor gas turbine engine in a new way. In this invention gas compression takes place by using pinwheel-like thrusters to induce a very high velocity full forced vortex in the gas being compressed. Much higher “tip” velocities can be achieved because no strength-limited solid centrifugal impeller is required to spin up the gas. Due to the consequent very high vortex velocity a single stage pressure ratio of twenty five to one, or more, may be possible. Because there is no high pressure turbine, the gas pressure delivered to some downstream useful work device is much higher than is the case with conventional gas turbine engines. The invention's compressor requires no major moving parts except for the gas flow. The consequence is that the invention is predicted to have substantially better performance and general characteristics than conventional gas turbine engines.","Richards Jr., Chester L.
