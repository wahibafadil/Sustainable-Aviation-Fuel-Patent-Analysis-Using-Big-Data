The rotorcraft may include a rotor having at least one tip nozzle, a compressor having an outlet for compressed air, and a network of conduits connecting the outlet of the compressor with the tip nozzle. In operation, the compressor may deliver a flow of compressed air to the tip nozzle. As the flow of compressed air exits the at least one tip nozzle, it may cause rotation of the rotor. This rotation may prerotate the rotor and shorten the take off distance required by the rotorcraft. Take off of the rotorcraft may be accomplished without ever adding fuel to the flow of compressed air to the tip nozzle.","Van Der, Westhuizen Jacob Johannes (South Jordan, UT, US)","GROEN BROTHERS AVIATION, INC (Salt Lake City, UT, US)",10/27/2011

US20120056034,US,03/08/2012,VARIABLE CYCLE VTOL POWERPLANT,"A VTOL aircraft powerplant choosing between a low-power, turbofan mode during cruise flight and a high-power, lift fan mode during vertical flight. Turbofan mode is a gas turbine engine's shaft power driving a remote front fan. Its fan flow goes to thrust for cruising flight. During VTOL, front fan output enters a boost compressor. It produces the compressed air for a combustion chamber which feeds a large lift-fan turbine. That is the implementation of lift-fan mode. The boost compressor has more stages than the front fan and is a big added load. The gas turbine engine is supercharged to turn that added load: Part of the boost compressor output is taken during VTOL. This is a new version of the supercharging. During cruise flight, a low pressure turbine stage is bypassed to match the lesser load. That completes the apparatus for a variable-cycle VTOL engine.","Kosheleff, Patrick A.
