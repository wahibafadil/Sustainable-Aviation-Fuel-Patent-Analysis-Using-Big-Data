WO/2015/092143A1,WIPO,2015-06-25,INTERGRATED PYROLYSIS PROCESS,"The present invention relates to an integrated pyrolysis process comprising the steps where feedstock comprising biomass is pyrolyzed in the presence of a heat transfer material comprising a solid reducing agent in reduced form to produce pyrolysis products char, gases and heat transfer material comprising the reducing agent in oxidized form, separating the pyrolysis products from the char and heat transfer material, separating pyrolysis oils from non-condensable gases, and directing the char and heat transfer material comprising the reducing agent to a boiler, feeding solid fuel to the boiler and combusting it in the presence of the heat transfer material comprising the reducing agent in the oxidized form to produce heat, flue gas and heat transfer material comprising the reducing agent in the reduced form, and conducting the heat transfer material comprising the reducing agent to the pyrolysis reactor.",ASIKKALA JANNE (FI); GUTIERREZ ANDREA (FI),UPM KYMMENE CORP (FI),2014-12-17
11788477,US,10/17/2023,Loading parameters,"An aircraft has first and second fuel sources containing fuels with different characteristics, and one or more gas turbine engines powered by the fuels and each having a staged combustion system having pilot and main fuel injectors and being operable in pilot-only and pilot-and-main ranges of operation. The gas turbine engines each have a fuel delivery regulator arranged to control fuel delivery to the pilot and main fuel injectors. The method includes: obtaining a proposed mission description; obtaining nvPM impact parameters for the gas turbine engines, the impact parameters being associated with each operating condition of the proposed mission; calculating an optimised set of one or more fuel characteristics for each flight condition of the proposed flight defined in the flight description based on the nvPM impact parameters; and determining a fuel allocation based on the optimised set of one or more fuel characteristics.","Swann, Peter (Derby, GB)

11686056,US,06/27/2023,Landing pad,"A landing pad including at least one integrally formed elongated hollow decking unit having an elongated landing plate with a plurality of holes, an elongated base plate aligned longitudinally with respect to the elongated landing plate which is designed as an orifice plate and spaced a distance apart from the elongated landing plate, and two elongated side wall plates connecting the elongated landing plate to the elongated base plate. The plurality of holes may be configured to drain unburned fuel spilled on the elongated landing plate through the plurality of holes into the elongated hollow decking unit and to suppress flame of burning fuel from propagating through the plurality of holes into the elongated hollow decking unit by reducing the temperature of drained unburned fuel. The distance apart between the elongated landing plate and the elongated base plate may be configured to prevent re-ignition of the drained unburned fuel on the elongated base plate inside the elongated hollow decking unit.","Uppal, Neelesh (Singapore, SG)","Aluminium Offshore Pte Ltd (Singapore, SG)",06/16/2016
