DE3924464C2,DE,1999-10-21,Ringf√∂rmige Brennkammer,An annular combustor for a gas turbine engine is constructed to include a sector that has a reduced airflow distribution than the remainder of the circumference by supplying a reduced airflow in a judiciously located portion of the fuel nozzles and the single stage of radially ingested combustion airflow. This single stage circumferential zoned annular combustor serves to accommodate higher fuel/air ratios.,DUBELL THOMAS L (US); SHADOWEN JAMES H (US),UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP (US),1989-07-24
11661907,US,05/30/2023,Vortex hybrid rocket motor,"Various embodiments of a vortex hybrid motor are described herein. In some embodiments, the vortex hybrid motor may include a combustion zone defined by a fuel core and/or motor housing. The combustion zone may include an upper zone and a central zone that each contribute to thrust created by the vortex hybrid motor. In some embodiments, an injection port configuration is described that includes a proximal injection port that may be controlled for modulating a delivery of an amount of oxidizer for adjusting an oxidizer-to-fuel ratio. In some embodiments, a fuel core configuration is described that provides radially varying gradients of fuel in order to achieve desired thrust profiles. In some embodiments, the fuel core may include a support structure and/or a proximal end of a nozzle of the vortex hybrid motor may extend into the fuel core.","Chiaverini, Martin (Sparks, NV, US)

7685824,US,03/30/2010,Rotary ramjet turbo-generator,"A Brayton-cycle rotary ramjet engine (10) operated within the confines of a helically elongated pass-through duct formed between a preferably stationary radially outward surface (14) and an outer rotating flow channel (36). The flow channel (36) is contoured between its inlet (34) and outlet (38) to include a supersonic diffuser (40), a combustor (42) and an expansion nozzle (44). Gaseous fuel, or liquid fuel atomized by a fuel slinger (58) within a housing (46), or solid fuel in the form of fine particulates, is inter-mixed with an oxidizer prior to being directed to the flow channel inlets (34). The air and fuel are combusted in the flow channels (36) and exhausted through the rear of the housing (46). A generator (22) can be coupled to a power shaft (18) to convert net shaft power into electricity. Preferably, the rotor (24) and stator (12) are fabricated from a ceramic or other high-temperature material so that combustor exit temperatures (T3) can be operated at highly efficient levels.","Dahm, Werner J.

9139297,US,09/22/2015,Rotor blade subsystems attachment,A rotor blade having conduits for supporting control lines is disclosed. The control lines extend from a rotor hub to a tip jet mounted near a distal end of the rotor blade. The conduits mount within leading and trailing edge fairings mounted to a blade spar. The conduits may be supported by bulkheads secured at discrete locations along the blade spar and secured to the leading and trailing edge fairings. The conduits may also be secured to support webs secured to the leading or trailing edge fairing and extending longitudinally therealong. The conduit may have a tapered inner surface and a tapered fitting may secure to the control line to engage the tapered inner surface.,"White, Robert Owen (Orillia, CA)","GROEN BROTHERS AVIATION, INC.

4840024,US,06/20/1989,Multiple propellant solid rocket motor,"An integrated stage rocket motor arrangement provides boost and repeated throttling post boost operations, on demand, and includes an attitude control system. The rocket motor includes a plurality of casings for enclosing an initial boost motor, a post boost motor, and gas generator means for producing gases that are used for re-ignition of the post boost motor and as a motive source for the attitude control system. The boost motor and post boost motor are contained within the same enclosure but are separated by an internal bulkhead. The rocket motor has a plurality of nozzles one of which is located aft of the boost motor and another located within the internal bulkhead that separates the boost and post boost motors.","Mcdonald, Allan J.
