The following technical results are achieved: increased flight safety and manoeuvring safety, increased load-bearing capacity and flight height in ground effect mode, reduced dimensions, improved take-off and landing characteristics, amphibian characteristics and economic efficiency, increased functionality and a wider range of operational alignments, and greater ease of use and maintenance. The above-mentioned result is achieved by the simultaneous application to the ""flying wing"" or ""composite wing"" design layouts of the methods for generating a system of aerodynamic forces, the structural solutions and the piloting methods conceptually linked therewith which are proposed in the present group of inventions. To ensure full longitudinal stability, the actual character of the dependencies of the lifting force value and position of the foci of the low aspect ratio (LAR) lifting wing of the above-mentioned design layouts on the angle of attack and flight height are changed by creating, in the longitudinal direction, at least two local zones having different conditions for the generation of lifting forces, the moments of which are mutually compensated for relative to the centre of mass. The local zones are created by substituting the basic LAR wing with at least two LAR wings (one front, one rear) which are mounted in tandem, but with a partial covering in the horizontal plane and with the formation of an air duct therebetween. The lower half of a slipstream from an annular screw propeller (ASP) mounted on the leading edge of the rear LAR wing is directed into the air duct. This ensures an air flow over the entire surface of the rear LAR wing and the sucking off of a layer of air over the entire span of the upper surface of the front LAR wing which smoothly adjoins the internal surface of the ASP ring. Therefore, only the lower surface of the front LAR wing interacts with a free approach stream. This substantially increases the distance between the foci in terms of height and angle of attack and makes it easier to obtain inherent longitudinal static and dynamic stability. The low aspect ratio wings and the ASP form a single structural base group which, together with aerodynamic float-type end plates and additional LAR wings mounted on the upper edges of the end plates, forms the propulsive lifting structure of the WIG craft. Furthermore, cavities for static, dynamic and static/dynamic air cushions are formed under the LAR wing while a region of low air pressure with reduced variation in the longitudinal direction is formed above the entire propulsive lifting structure. Longitudinal balancing and additional controllability are ensured by controlling the front and rear lifting force values by changing the angles of inclination of the flaperons of the LAR wings. Full damping of longitudinal oscillations is ensured with the aid of the automatic control of the front and rear lifting force values, during which the front and rear elevators provided can simultaneously act as angle of attack sensors and as a power drive. By means of the spatial and quantitative configuration of the structural base groups, fuselages, float-type end plates, additional LAR wings, consoles, and stabilizing and steering surfaces, and also the specific structural design thereof, said group of inventions makes it possible to create aircraft having different functional possibilities, in different weight categories. The structural characteristics of the above WIG craft are necessary and sufficient to substantially increase the flight safety with the aid of a method in which, in all of the modes and at all of the heights identified for WIG craft flights, all of the elements and flight stages, including manoeuvres in height, are carried out with a constant pitch angle corresponding to the horizontal position of the fuselage.",NOVIKOV-KOPP IVAN (DE),NOVIKOV-KOPP IVAN (DE),2010-01-05

The uncorrected signal appears at the output of 57 and is filtered at 59 and integrated at 60, the output of which is said to be the desired, corrected signal. This is fed back as shown for subtraction at 58 from the uncorrected signal, the output of 58 thus being the dynamic weight errors signal only. This is in turn fed back on line 63 to correct that portion of the computer 49' which calculates the actual coefficient of lift C/L, and this is the subject of the main claim. The amount of feedback used is determined by KW and is set to allow for slow changes e.g. due to fuel consumption. The signal W is the weight supported by the wings; during take off this varies rapidly so at this time an alternative filter 59', having a short time constant, is switched in. The switch, 204, is controlled by a lift off detector 26 which responds to the tilt angle #, measured by a gyroscope. The invention claimed is also applicable to an angle of attack computer which comprises means 45, 46 reponsive to the values shown on the left of Fig 8 for providing an initial angle of attack signal sin α that includes dynamic error components which are then eliminated as shown in Fig.9 by feeding back a signal on line 63 corresponding to weight error, which is derived as described above.

DE3226070A1,DE,1983-04-21,LUFTFAHRZEUG UND ANORDNUNGEN DAFUER,"A rotor having airfoil-section shaped blades is set into a fluid stream. Over a connection-or-transmission means a propeller is connected to the rotor. The fluid stream whereinto the rotor is set gives airflow energy to the rotor and revolves the rotor. The propeller is driven by the rotor over the connection-or transmission means. Since the propeller is revolved by the rotor in the fluid stream, the propeller provides a thrust. The thrust may be used to lift a weight or to drive a member. A suitable application of the arrangement is for example, to transform a multi-bladed helicopter into a gliding craft which descends under a gliding angle towards the surface of the earth, when the helicopter has a complete engine failure. Auto-rotation accidents can thereby become prevented. The device is also applicable to drive a vehicle or to lift a weight. Variable means can be applied to obtain variable thrusts in flying craft to improve their efficiencies or change from one flight-system to another flight system.

DE102014008493A1,DE,2015-12-17,Verfahren zur Steigerung der Effizienz an thermischen Abgas-Reinigungsanlagen,"Thermische Abgasreinigungsanlagen (TAR) werden in der Industrie zur Reinigung von schadstoffbelasteten Prozess- und Produktionsabluft-Volumenströmen eingesetzt. Dabei werden in einer Brennkammer die Schadstoffe in neutrale Verbrennungsprodukte umgewandelt und als Bestandteil der Abgase in die Umgebung ausgeleitet. Durch Einsatz von Luftvorwärmern wird der zusätzliche Brennstoffenergiebedarf verringert. Das gereinigte Gas verlässt die Brennkammer je nach Einsatzfall mit Temperaturen zwischen 750 und 1.200°C und wird anschließend in einem Luftvorwärmer zwecks Vorwärmung des Rohgases abgekühlt. Die verbleibende Wärme im Abgas kann in Abhitzekesseln aufgenommen werden. Meist ist jedoch eine Verwendung der Wärme nicht möglich. Daher wurde versucht, die hochtemperierte Wärme der Abgase mittels Dampfkraft- oder ORC-Anlagen in elektrische Energie umzuwandeln und damit die Effizienz des Systems zu verbessern. Dies scheitert aber stets daran, dass sowohl Dampfkraft- als auch ORC-Anlagen keine ausreichende Effizienz aufweisen und ihre Installation mit einem sehr hohen, nicht vertretbaren technischen Aufwand verbunden wäre. Ein wesentlicher Grund hierfür ist, dass in diesen Anlagen geschlossene Prozesse mit z. T. sehr hohen Drücken angewendet werden müssen. Die hier vorgeschlagene Lösung basiert auf einem offenen Joule-Prozess, der drucklos und im Unterdruck betrieben wird. Durch das begrenzte Druckniveau wird auch bei kleinen Anlagen eine hohe Effizienz ermöglicht. Die Verwendung von preiswerten Serienprodukten aus der Motorenindustrie ermöglicht die Ausführung der Systeme als Mehrwellenanlagen und damit auch zusätzliche Prozessverbesserungen, die weder in Dampfkraft- noch in ORC-Anlagen realisiert werden können. Diese Zusatzeinrichtung zur Steigerung der Effizienz von thermischen Abgasreinigungsanlagen kann in allen weltweit neu zu installierenden Anlagen sowie in vielen vorhandenen Abgasreinigungsanlagen eingesetzt werden.

These reactions are thermally reversible by the removal of metal vapor in the reverse exchange. The hydrino reactions are maintained and regenerated in a batch mode using thermally- coupled multi-cells arranged in bundles wherein cells in the power-production phase of the cycle heat cells in the regeneration phase. In this intermittent cell power design, the thermal power is statistically constant as the cell number becomes large, or the cells cycle is controlled to achieve steady power. In another power system embodiment, the hydrino reactions are maintained and regenerated continuously in each cell wherein heat from the power production phase of a thermally reversible cycle provides the energy for regeneration of the initial reactants from the products. Since the reactants undergo both modes simultaneously in each cell, the thermal power output from each cell is constant. Thermal power is converted to electrical power by a heat engine exploiting a cycle such as a Rankine, Brayton, Stirling, or steam-engine cycle. In another embodiment, the exchange reactions are constituted in half-cell reactions as the basis of a unique fuel cell wherein direct electrical power is developed with energy released by the reaction of hydrogen to form hydrinos.",MILLS RANDELL L (US),BLACKLIGHT POWER INC (US); MILLS RANDELL L (US),2010-03-18

However, such methods are directed only to braking spacecraft when returning from space expeditions. This method does not make possible to perform a cruise flight in the atmosphere starting from the surface of a planet and is also not capable of accelerating in the upper layers of the atmosphere to velocities exceeding the first cosmic velocity without moving out into outer space since the centrifugal force of the local orbital cosmic velocity exceeds the force of gravitation. Also known are devices comprising hypersonic aircraft performing a flight in the upper layers of the atmosphere which are not capable of achieving the first cosmic velocity whilst performing further acceleration as a result of the incapacity for full combustion of fuel in hypersonic direct-flow chambers and a weak system of air inlets as well as the extremely high temperature conditions to which the air frame and the elements thereof (pillars, empennage, air inlets, projecting portions, pods etc.) of hypersonic aircraft are subjected.",ALEKSANDROV OLEG ALEKSANDROVICH (RU),ALEKSANDROV OLEG ALEKSANDROVICH (RU),2013-07-31

Therefore, clean combustion is achieved with the FB injection for fuels with distinct properties without fuel preheating or hardware modification. However, in addition to the droplets, the FB injection also produces ligaments for highly viscous liquids and relatively larger droplets at spray edge, resulting in difficulty in sustaining the flame and performs incomplete combustion and higher emissions close to the combustor all. The disclosed swirl burst injector and method utilizes the advantages of FB injection and swirl atomization to further improve atomization, and overcomes the limitations of FB injection, providing a sustainable way to use both conventional and alternative fuels with improved efficiency and minimized emissions.

Hydrazine and hydrazine blends have been considered for liquid gas generators because of their ability to decompose at ambient conditions on an iridium catalyst to form warm (1000° F. to 1500° F.) gases. Hydrazine is undesirable because of its toxicity and high melting point (34° F.). The tertiary amine azides, which are defined hereinabove and below, are non-carcinogenic alternatives to hydrazine in liquid or gel gas generator systems. These tertiary amines azides are non-carcinogenic alternatives for use with a thermal reactor bed where exothermic reaction releases enough heat to sustain decomposition for furnishing gases for gas generator systems employed. A tertiary amine typically has three hydrocarbons moieties attached to the nitrogen atom. The tertiary amine azides of this invention can have no more than seven carbon atoms in the molecules. Further, these tertiary amine azides can contain no more than two azide moieties that are attached at the opposite end of the hydrocarbon portions from the amine nitrogen atom. A special case that still meet these requirements is pyrollidine moiety (five atom cyclic structure wherein each end of a linear four carbon atom structure is attached to a common nitrogen atom), and the common nitrogen atom has as attached ethyl azide moiety. A fuel gel propellant fuel that would be a suitable replacement for MMH must be less toxic and have a competitive density impulse for the same engine operating conditions. Three compounds meeting the specified requirements have been synthesized and their physical and chemical properties are evaluated herein as shown in Table 1. The chemical names for these compounds are dimethylaminoethylazide (DMAZ), pyrollidinylethylazide (PYAZ), and bis(ethyazide)methylamine (BAZ). DMAZ has a density of 0.933 and a heat of formation of 580 (cal/g) as compared with MMH having a density of 0.88 and heat of formation of 276 (cal/g).","Thompson, Darren M.

If a pilot learns the correct procedures for recovery from an upset, as in the prior art URT programs, but cannot execute the procedures in the real world because he or she has not been prepared for the physiological environment to be faced, then safety is compromised. Embodiments of the present invention address this deficiency.","Glaser, Scott (Rosamond, CA, US)

Use results in less corrosion, ash formation and emissions (NOx, SOx, CO2 and noxious metals) than firing contaminated heavy crude, refinery residual oils or high sulfur fuel oils. Manufacture is by decontaminating crude oils, non-conventional crudes, and other highly contaminated feeds. Each fuel is produced as a single product of unit operations, not ex-plant blend of various refinery products, yet using an apparatus configuration less complex than conventional crude oil refining. These fuels can be fired by advanced high efficiency turbines of combined cycle power plants having hot flow paths and heat recovery steam generation systems susceptible to corrosion, which systems cannot otherwise risk contaminated heavy crudes or refinery residual oils feeds.","Wohaibi, Mohammed (Nacogdoches, TX, US)

Marine shipping use of high sulfur bunker oils is reported as largest source of world-wide transportation SOx emissions. When ships on the open seas burn cheap low grade heavy bunker oils high in sulfur, nitrogen and metals, the SOx, NOx, and metal oxides go to the environment. This invention converts essentially all of each barrel of crude feed to a single ultraclean fuel versus conventional refining where crude feed is cut into many pieces, and each piece is sent down a separate market path meeting various different product specifications.

Ideally suited for 50 to 500 shaft horsepower (SHP) range aircraft applications such as GA, UAS, UAS, air taxi, helicopters and commercial markets. The engine design features with centrifugal compressor and radial turbine rotors has a high-end practical limit of ˜800 (SHP). The new turboprop incorporates 2 non-concentric spools aero-thermal—pressure coupled wherein staged compressor rotors lend to a simple engine design, optimized high overall engine pressure ratio (OPR) and low specific fuel consumption (SFC). An integral starter-generator system further simplifies the engine design and offers high electrical output power capability for auxiliary power requirements. A 2-stage low emissions combustor with fuel-air premix chambers is incorporated lending to stable combustion at any engine spool speed/power requirement, further fuel optimization and use of a low cost simple fixed pitch propeller. Some other highlights include: any fuel or mixture thereof, TBO greater than piston or other turbine engines, less maintenance costs, oil/filter change at ˜15000 hrs. and other inherent advantages of a gas turbine engine.
Of the two spools that make up this turboprop engine, one is the High Pressure (HP) spool that is part of the gas generator using combustor hot gases to power the integral HP turbine rotor, HP compressor and high-speed alternator starter—generator. The other engine spool is the Low-Pressure (LP) spool that receives the HP turbine exhaust heat energy to power the integral LP compressor rotor, LP turbine rotor, integrated gearbox with resultant output shaft horsepower.

MSA from this process can be sold or used as a valuable chemical with no mercaptan or halogen impurities, or it can be heated and cracked to release methanol (a clean fuel, gasoline additive, and chemical feedstock) and sulfur dioxide (which can be oxidized to SO3 and recycled back into the reactor).

An autopilot system is programmed for rapid descent, in response to a cabin depressurization condition detected by an air pressure sensor, to a flight level where there is sufficient oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain full consciousness. When in the rapid descent mode, the autopilot cuts engine power to idle, reduces the angle of attack, maximizes parasitic drag, and initiates a maximum descent rate without exceeding the aircraft's design limitations. As the aircraft approaches a lower altitude capable of sustaining full human consciousness, the autopilot system increases the angle of attack, reduces parasitic drag, and increases engine power, thereby causing the aircraft to fly level at the lower altitude until the pilot reasserts control of the aircraft.","Fox III, Angus C.

The substitutent hydrocarbon radicals of the aromatic hydroxy compound and/or the aromatic nucleus may be substituted by chlorine.  The substituents may be alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl groups, such as butyl to decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, octadecylenyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, ethylcyclohexyl, dimethylcyclohexyl, propylcyclohexyl, trimethylcyclohexyl, dicyclohexyl, methylated dicyclohexyl, benzyl or ethylphenyl.  The aromatic nuclus may be mono or dicyclic, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, tetraline or diphenyl.  The aldehyde is preferably formaldehyde or acetaldehyde.  The metal of the salt of the resinous condensation product is preferably an alkaline earth metal but may be another polyvalent metal such as copper, zinc, aluminium, lead, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium or tin. The salt, if difficulty soluble in oil, may be incorporated in oil as described in U.S. Specification 2,042,880 or in many cases may be dissolved in a solvent such as benzene, which may then, while adding oil, be gradually removed by passing an inert gas through the mixture at an elevated temperature.  The concentrate thus obtained may then be diluted with further oil. An example is given of the preparation of the calcium salt of a condensation product of formaldehyde and p-isooctylphenol.  The aromatic amine may contain one or more substituents, such as hydroxyl, chloro, alkoxy, hydroxyalkyl, amino, N-alkylated amino or N-alkylated amino alkylene, radicals.  Preferred anti-oxidants are the naphthylamines, primary, secondary or tertiary aryl or aralkyl amines having at least two aromatic rings, such as phenyl beta-naphthylamine, tetraline naphthylamine, alpha-alpha, alpha-beta or beta-beta dinaphthylamine, various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl naphthylamines, xenyl naphthylamines, benzyl-phenyl naphthylamines, diphenayl - naphthyl - amines, phenyl-xenyl naphthylamines, dixenyl-naphthylamines, and various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl phenyl amines.  In general the N-aryl substituted naphthylamines are preferred.  An example of a naphthylamine which is substituted by a second amino group is 1, 8 diamino naphthalene. Alternatively there may be used diamino diaryl alkanes such as diamino diphenyl methane, tetramethyl diamino triphenyl methane, tetra ethyl diamino triphenyl methane, diamino diphenyl ethane, and diamino ditolyl ethane, or alkylated diaryl amines such as p-ethyl diphenylamine, m-ethyl diphenylamine, p-isopropyl diphenylamine, mono-and polyamyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, hexadecyl, cyclohexyl, methyl cyclohexyl and other alkyl substituted diphenylamine and p-methoxy-p1-isopropyl diphenylamine.  The lubricating oil may also contain oil-soluble salts of bases such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, zinc, cadmium, aluminium, tin, chromium, nickel and cobalt (and of organic bases including primary, secondary, or tertiary amino and quaternary ammonium compounds) combined with such organic acids as fatty acids of 10-30 carbon atoms, wool fat acids, acids produced by oxidation of paraffin wax, chlorinated fatty acids, rosin acids, fatty and hydroxy fatty acids containing aromatic constituents, aromatic carboxylic acids including paraffin wax benzoic acids, alkyl salicylic acids, phthalic acid mono-esters, aromatic keto of ether acids, diphenols such as di(alkylphenol) sulphides and disulphides, sulphonic acids derived from alkyl aryl hydrocarbons or from high boiling petroleum oils, sulphuric acid mono-esters; phosphoric, arsenic and antimonic acid mono- and diesters, including mono- and di-esters of the corresponding thiophosphoric, thio arsenic and thio antimonic acids, phosphonic and arsonic acids.  Examples of these auxiliary detergents are the alkaline earth phosphate and thiophosphate di-esters and the alkaline earth diphenolates, specifically the calcium and barium salts of diphenol mono and polysulphides.  The calcium salts of oil-soluble petroleum sulphonic acid are said to be particularly advantageous.  Other auxiliary additives may include phosphatides such as lecithin, fatty oils such as rape oil, and voltolized fatty or mineral oils.  Anti-rusting compounds such as dicarboxylic acids of 16 or more carbon atoms or organic compounds containing an acidic radical very near to a nitrile, nitro or nitroso group (e.g. alpha cyano stearic acid) and alkali metal salts of sulphonic acids or fatty acids may also be present. Other additives such as blooming agents, pour-point depressants, viscosity improvers, auxiliary anti-oxidants, extreme pressure agents and anti-foaming agents may be present.  Examples of auxiliary anti-oxidants are alkyl phenols such as 2, 4, 6-trimethylphenol, pentamethylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-tertiary-butylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-octylphenol, 2, 6-ditertiary-butyl-4-methylphenol, and 2, 4, 6-tritertiary-butylphenol.

The process involves inserting the shaped pieces of RPF through existing access ports into a fuel tank in order to fill the tank, excepting minimal planned void spaces. This process effects ignition mitigation by acting as an ignition blocker, mechanically interfering with the compression wave that precedes the flame front in an explosion, and changing the vaporous mixture above the fuel level (ullage) in the tank. The foam pieces are assembled and fitted together throughout the tank in a pattern that replicates the shape of the tank. After the foam insertion is complete, the fuel tank is filled with purging fluid, drained through a filter until no debris is found, and the new maximum fuel quantity is recalibrated.","Williams, Michael D.

This system and method uses a coaxial cavity resonator in a body adapted to mate with a combustion chamber of a combustion engine. The coaxial cavity resonator is coupled with an energy shaping means that develops the appropriate waveform for triggering radio frequency oscillations in the coaxial cavity resonator. A connection means on the apparatus allows for the apparatus to accept an electrical ignition stimulus from an electronic ignition control system. The coaxial cavity resonator develops corona discharge plasma at a discharge electrode when a sustained radio frequency oscillation results in a standing wave in the coaxial cavity resonator. The corona discharge plasma developed near the discharge electrode ignites the combustible materials in the combustion chamber of the combustion engine.,"Smith, James E.

These radicals combine with sulfur trioxide to form methyl-sulfonate radicals. These radicals attack fresh methane, forming stable methane-sulfonic acid (MSA) while creating new methyl radicals to sustain a chain reaction. This system avoids the use or creation of water, and liquid MSA is an amphoteric solvent that increases the solubility and reactivity of methane and SO3. MSA from this process can be sold or used as a valuable chemical with no mercaptan or halogen impurities, or it can be processed to convert it into methanol, dimethyl ether, or other fuels or liquid products. The sulfur that is removed from the MSA (usually in the form of SO2) can be oxidized to SO3 and recycled back into the MSA-forming reactor, enabling the complete system to operate with very little waste production.","Richards, Alan K.

[Class 7 (iii)] A carburetter body formed in two sections has a float chamber and a double Venturi cast integral with one of the sections. A downdraught carburetter comprises an upper body portion 8, preferably of aluminium alloy and formed by die casting, and a lower body portion 9 preferably of cast iron and formed as a plain tube with relatively thin walls and separated from the upper portion by a non- conducting gasket 10. A choke valve 13 mounted on a shaft 14 is provided with a poppet valve 15. The upper section is cast with a float chamber 21 and also with an inner Venturi 36 and an outer Venturi 34, this being made possible by a fin 38 which contains the nozzle in the form of a tubular member 45 held in place by a metering plug 53. Tube 45 is cut away on its outer surface at 54 to provide an air-bleed passage, which communicates at one end with the bore of the tube through ports 56, and at the other end with the main air passage through a duct 60. The tube is also cut away circumferentially at 62 to provide communication with an idling duct 64, 66 which leads, through passage 72, Fig. 4, to a nozzle 76 beyond the throttle valve 19. The throttle is actuated through a lever 82 and the other end of the spindle has an arm 88, Fig. 5, connected to one arm 92 of a jointed lever the other arm 93 of which is connected to the rod 98, Fig. 4, of an accelerating pump. The members of the jointed lever turn about a pin 94, Fig. 3, and are normally held by a spring 97 so that the arm 92 is in contact with a stop 96 on the arm 93. On rapid opening of the throttle 19, the lever arms are relatively displaced against the tension of the spring with the result that the plunger of the accelerating pump has a slow and prolonged movement. The cylinder 102 of the accelerating pump is cast with the upper body section 8 and communicates with the float chamber through a port 103, Fig. 5. The lower end of the cylinder is connected through a port 111 with an accelerating-fuel nozzle 112, Fig. 4. In a modification, Fig. 8, (not shown) a second fin is provided in alignment with the fin 38, and the inner Venturi is provided at its upper end with a cap which constitutes the main nozzle. The cap is recessed on its outer surface to form a chamber registering with the fuel passage and communicating with the Venturi through holes in the cap.","Chandler, Milton E.",BENDIX AVIAT CORP,05/07/1932

The action of the pump piston adiabatically compresses and heats a light gas of hydrogen or helium, bursting a diaphragm at a predetermined pressure and expelling the projectile from the launch tube at a very high speed.","Koth, Philip Edward (East Peoria, IL, US)",Assignee not found,04/18/2007

The strake fence flap is deployed along the upper surface of each of the strakes on the canard aircraft. The strake fence flap is hinged along its lower edge which allows it to be retracted and extended as needed. In the cruise configuration, the strake fence flap is folded flush with the strake upper surface. For deceleration or landing where increased lift and drag are required, the strake fence flap is extended. The frontal area of the strake fence flap becomes exposed resulting in additional drag. The geometry and positioning of the fence causes the flow to separate from the upper edge of the fence and to roll up into a vortex which trails over the strake. The intense suction which accompanies the vortex acts directly on the strake upper surface, thereby significantly increasing the lift.","Vess, Robert J. (Raleigh, NC)

The main and basic invention is Nuclear Aircraft Transportation System “KARAVAN” (NATS). This invention includes two other ones: Aircraft Thrust Nuclear Power Plant, (ATNPP), which in turn includes—Thermal Power Cycle of ATNPP, (TPC ATNPP). In addition, the represented group of inventions is made up of two more inventions: Maintenance System of ATNPP, (MS ATNPP) and Emergency Response System of NATSK, (ERS NATSK).
The concept of practical implementation of the presented group of inventions involves the fact that ATNPP, which is a large unmanned drone aircraft “Tiagach”, supplies the aero-train composed of a number of passenger liners and cargo transport planes using electric motors with traction electric energy in the air.
The power supply of such an aero-train is based on the onboard Nuclear Power Plant of the aircraft “Tiagach”. In this case, the transmission of electric power to the towed electric aircraft of the aero-train is carried out by means of electric split feeders and cables, connecting and disconnecting of which between airplanes of the aero-train is carried out in the air, by analogy with refueling of airplanes in the air with JP fuel.
During the flight of the aero-train on a logistically optimized route, electric airplanes can detach from and attach to the aero-train, taking off and landing along the flight route of the aero-train using their own electric accumulators. In addition, extra ATNPP may be included in the aero-train during its flight, if it is necessary to increase the thrust. At the same time, due to the use of nuclear power, such ATNPP can remain in the air for a conditionally indefinite period of time.
The invention is aimed at creating cost-effective air freight and passenger traffic.","Sevastyanov, Vladimir Petrovich (Novosibirsk, RU)

The proposed process effects the separation of CO2 from a mixture of gases (such as flue gas/fuel gas) by its reaction with metal oxides (such as calcium oxide). The Calcium based Reaction Separation for CO2 (CaRS-CO2) process consists of contacting a CO2 laden gas with calcium oxide (CaO) in a reactor such that CaO captures the CO2 by the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Once “spent”, CaCO3 is regenerated by its calcination leading to the formation of fresh CaO sorbent and the evolution of a concentrated stream of CO2. The “regenerated” CaO is then recycled for the further capture of more CO2. This carbonation-calcination cycle forms the basis of the CaRS-CO2 process. This process also identifies the application of a mesoporous CaCO3 structure, developed by a process detailed elsewhere, that attains >90% conversion over multiple carbonation and calcination cycles. Lastly, thermal regeneration (calcination) under vacuum provided a better sorbent structure that maintained reproducible reactivity levels over multiple cycles.","Fan, Liang-shih (Columbus, OH, US)

2410652,US,11/05/1946,Compounded lubricating oil,"Compounded lubricating oils contain (1) an oil-miscible metal salt of the condensation product of an aldehyde and a hydrocarbon-substituted aromatic hydroxy compound in which the hydroxyl group is attached to a nuclear carbon atom and which has an unsubstituted position ortho to the hydroxyl group, in an amount sufficient to give high-temperature detergent action in an internal combustion engine, and (2) a minor proportion, generally not exceeding 5 per cent and usually 0.2-0.4 per cent by weight of an oil-soluble anti-oxidant which is an aromatic amine containing at least two benzene rings (other than phenyl-alpha-naphthylamine and tetramethyl - diamino-diphenyl - methane), such of the sulphate ash yielded by the oil as is derived from said salt not exceeding 0.25 per cent based on the oil and being usually 0.04-0.2 per cent.  The substitutent hydrocarbon radicals of the aromatic hydroxy compound and/or the aromatic nucleus may be substituted by chlorine.  The substituents may be alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl groups, such as butyl to decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, octadecylenyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, ethylcyclohexyl, dimethylcyclohexyl, propylcyclohexyl, trimethylcyclohexyl, dicyclohexyl, methylated dicyclohexyl, benzyl or ethylphenyl.  The aromatic nuclus may be mono or dicyclic, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, tetraline or diphenyl.  The aldehyde is preferably formaldehyde or acetaldehyde.  The metal of the salt of the resinous condensation product is preferably an alkaline earth metal but may be another polyvalent metal such as copper, zinc, aluminium, lead, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium or tin. The salt, if difficulty soluble in oil, may be incorporated in oil as described in U.S. Specification 2,042,880 or in many cases may be dissolved in a solvent such as benzene, which may then, while adding oil, be gradually removed by passing an inert gas through the mixture at an elevated temperature.  The concentrate thus obtained may then be diluted with further oil. An example is given of the preparation of the calcium salt of a condensation product of formaldehyde and p-isooctylphenol.  The aromatic amine may contain one or more substituents, such as hydroxyl, chloro, alkoxy, hydroxyalkyl, amino, N-alkylated amino or N-alkylated amino alkylene, radicals.  Preferred anti-oxidants are the naphthylamines, primary, secondary or tertiary aryl or aralkyl amines having at least two aromatic rings, such as phenyl beta-naphthylamine, tetraline naphthylamine, alpha-alpha, alpha-beta or beta-beta dinaphthylamine, various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl naphthylamines, xenyl naphthylamines, benzyl-phenyl naphthylamines, diphenayl - naphthyl - amines, phenyl-xenyl naphthylamines, dixenyl-naphthylamines, and various phenanthryl, anthryl or picyl phenyl amines.  In general the N-aryl substituted naphthylamines are preferred.  An example of a naphthylamine which is substituted by a second amino group is 1, 8 diamino naphthalene. Alternatively there may be used diamino diaryl alkanes such as diamino diphenyl methane, tetramethyl diamino triphenyl methane, tetra ethyl diamino triphenyl methane, diamino diphenyl ethane, and diamino ditolyl ethane, or alkylated diaryl amines such as p-ethyl diphenylamine, m-ethyl diphenylamine, p-isopropyl diphenylamine, mono-and polyamyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, hexadecyl, cyclohexyl, methyl cyclohexyl and other alkyl substituted diphenylamine and p-methoxy-p1-isopropyl diphenylamine.  The lubricating oil may also contain oil-soluble salts of bases such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, zinc, cadmium, aluminium, tin, chromium, nickel and cobalt (and of organic bases including primary, secondary, or tertiary amino and quaternary ammonium compounds) combined with such organic acids as fatty acids of 10-30 carbon atoms, wool fat acids, acids produced by oxidation of paraffin wax, chlorinated fatty acids, rosin acids, fatty and hydroxy fatty acids containing aromatic constituents, aromatic carboxylic acids including paraffin wax benzoic acids, alkyl salicylic acids, phthalic acid mono-esters, aromatic keto of ether acids, diphenols such as di(alkylphenol) sulphides and disulphides, sulphonic acids derived from alkyl aryl hydrocarbons or from high boiling petroleum oils, sulphuric acid mono-esters; phosphoric, arsenic and antimonic acid mono- and diesters, including mono- and di-esters of the corresponding thiophosphoric, thio arsenic and thio antimonic acids, phosphonic and arsonic acids.  Examples of these auxiliary detergents are the alkaline earth phosphate and thiophosphate di-esters and the alkaline earth diphenolates, specifically the calcium and barium salts of diphenol mono and polysulphides.  The calcium salts of oil-soluble petroleum sulphonic acid are said to be particularly advantageous.  Other auxiliary additives may include phosphatides such as lecithin, fatty oils such as rape oil, and voltolized fatty or mineral oils.  Anti-rusting compounds such as dicarboxylic acids of 16 or more carbon atoms or organic compounds containing an acidic radical very near to a nitrile, nitro or nitroso group (e.g. alpha cyano stearic acid) and alkali metal salts of sulphonic acids or fatty acids may also be present. Other additives such as blooming agents, pour-point depressants, viscosity improvers, auxiliary anti-oxidants, extreme pressure agents and anti-foaming agents may be present.  Examples of auxiliary anti-oxidants are alkyl phenols such as 2, 4, 6-trimethylphenol, pentamethylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-tertiary-butylphenol, 2, 4-dimethyl-6-octylphenol, 2, 6-ditertiary-butyl-4-methylphenol, and 2, 4, 6-tritertiary-butylphenol.  The compounded lubricating oil is especially suitable for use in aviation engines.","Griffin Jr., John R.

The gear driven disk gear drives a planetary sun gear through a telescoping shaft to transfer rotation to a geared base unit and dual output shafts through the planetary planet gears. This generates the mechanism's low speed output. User-actuated repositioning of the disk gear away from the mechanism central axis induces concurrent disk gear swing rotation as it is driven around the central axis. This swing rotation is extracted by a variable orbital arm and transferred to infinitely variably accelerate the base unit and the dual output shafts, generating the mechanism's infinitely variable output speed increases. The base unit next cycles its accelerated rotation into the rotating variable orbital arm, disk gear, and planetary sun gear through the planetary gear set planet gears to sustain the mechanism's increased operational speed. Two interconnected geared-neutral bidirectional output mechanisms are described; one integrated within the transmission, and one separated from the transmission.","Coronel, Paul Kay (Tutwiler, MS, US)",Assignee not found,08/22/2005

The wrapping process is accomplished automatically by a wrapping machine. Since the inflatable surface can be packaged into a small volume, and since the sheets of wrapping material can be rolled into spools with very high packing density, it is possible to construct large continuous-walled pressurized structures in orbit using robotics with relatively few Shuttle flights. The method is used to construct a large permanently manned orbiting space station that provides an artificial gravity environment for the living quarters and connecting variable gravity environments for research and materials processing.

The airfoil is provided with a plurality of apertures and a source of pressurized fluid for providing a flow of fluid through the apertures to establish an aerodynamic radius. The aerodynamic radius of curvature of leading edge is sufficiently greater than the mechanical radius of curvature of the leading edge that peak heat flux is independent of the mechanical radius of curvature. The mechanical radius of curvature is preferably less than 50% of the aerodynamic radius of curvature during hypersonic operation. Preferably the mechanical radius of curvature is the smallest allowed by the fabrication method (i.e., a knife edge), such as being less than about 0.02 inches, preferably less than about 0.01 inches. The transpiration blowing rate can be adjusted so that the blowing rate and aerodynamic radius of curvature are relatively low except during periods of maximum heat flux, such as the shock-on-lip point. Since the mechanical radius of curvature is effectively zero, control of the aerodynamic radius of curvature provides complete control of peak heat flux. By adjusting blowing rate to the minimum necessary at any given velocity, transpiration consumption, drag and fuel injection are reduced or eliminated.","Bulman, Melvin J.

Wingtip extensions on the two main wings extend aft to attach to the T-tail. The powerplants consist of two four cylinder two-stroke reciprocating internal combustion engines. Power from the engines is distributed between the ducted fan and tractor propeller through the use of a drivetrain incorporating two pneumatic clutches, controlled by an automotive style footpedal to the left of the rudder pedals. When depressed, power is transmitted to the ducted fan for vertical lift. When released, power is transmitted to the tractor propeller for forward flight. The aircraft can also takeoff and land in the conventional manner with a much larger payload, and is easily converted to amphibious usage. Landing gear is a bicycle arrangement with outriggers. The aircraft combines twin engines, heavy-duty landing gear, controlled-collapse crashworthy seats with a low stall speed and high resistance to stalls to eliminate any region of the flight regime where an engine or drivetrain failure could cause an uncontrollable crash.","Churchman, Charles Gilpin (Norcross, GA, US)",CHURCHMAN CHARLES GILPIN,12/09/2002

6974106,US,12/13/2005,V/STOL biplane,"The present invention is a 2 passenger aircraft capable of vertical and conventional takeoffs and landings, called a jyrodyne. The jyrodyne comprises a central fuselage with biplane-type wings arranged in a negative stagger arrangement, a horizontal ducted fan inlet shroud located at the center of gravity in the top biplane wing, a rotor mounted in the shroud, outrigger wing support landing gear, a forward mounted canard wing and passenger compartment, a multiple vane-type air deflector system for control and stability in VTOL mode, a separate tractor propulsion system for forward flight, and a full-span T-tail. Wingtip extensions on the two main wings extend aft to attach to the T-tail. The powerplants consist of two four cylinder two-stroke reciprocating internal combustion engines. Power from the engines is distributed between the ducted fan and tractor propeller through the use of a drivetrain incorporating two pneumatic clutches, controlled by an automotive style footpedal to the left of the rudder pedals. When depressed, power is transmitted to the ducted fan for vertical lift. When released, power is transmitted to the tractor propeller for forward flight. The aircraft can also takeoff and land in the conventional manner with a much larger payload, and is easily converted to amphibious usage. Landing gear is a bicycle arrangement with outriggers. The aircraft combines twin engines, heavy-duty landing gear, controlled-collapse crashworthy seats with a low stall speed and high resistance to stalls to eliminate any region of the flight regime where an engine or drivetrain failure could cause an uncontrollable crash.","Churchman, Charles Gilpin (Norcross, GA, US)",Assignee not found,04/08/2004

(2) Recapturing the moisture evaporated from the biomass in step 1 for use in the process gas. (3) Heating the dried biomass in a second molten liquid bath at a second temperature, wherein the second temperature is sufficiently high to cause flash pyrolysis of the dried biomass, thereby yielding product gases, tar, and char. (4) Inserting recaptured steam into the process gas, which may optionally include external natural gas or hydrogen gas or recycled syngas for mixing and reforming with tar and non-condensable gases. (5) Further reacting the product gases, tar, and char with the process gas within a third molten liquid bath at a third temperature which is equal to or greater than the second temperature within the second molten liquid bath, thereby yielding high quality and relatively clean synthesis gas after a relatively long residence time needed for char gasification.

4059247,US,11/22/1977,Convertiblade,"An aircraft which operates between the surface and the air as a rotating wing aircraft (helicopter-autogiro). When airborne a rotor pylon latch is released and the pilot flies the rotor system aft about its pivot to the fuselage to form the tail of a high speed jet propelled airplane. Altering the pitch angle of the blades controls the aircraft, called a convertiblade, for helicopter-autogiro and airplane configurations and for moving the rotor between its configurations. The rotor is revved up with rocket fuel piped to burner jet nozzles located at the blade tips. A jump-take-off may be used to efficiently get the convertiblade airborne at a good climbing speed. Prior to landing, the rotor blades are released from their operation as roll control surfaces for the airplane configuration; then, they are permitted to rev-up and act as a brake to reduce the speed of the airplane. At a suitable speed, the pylon is released from the fuselage and the rotor system is flown by the pilot's controls up into autogiro configuration where it automatically latches permitting the pilot to make a flared autogiro landing. The transition between autogiro and airplane takes place in a very short period of time. The fuselage is kept stable during the transitions by the pilot's controls and by establishing lateral, directional, and longitudinal stability through relationships between the center of gravity and the center of all fin-areas of the aircraft for each regime of flight. Several methods of augmenting the rotor controls during transition are presented including the use of combined wing tip elevators and ailerons.","Prewitt, Richard H.

Turbofan mode is a gas turbine engine's shaft power driving a remote front fan. Its fan flow goes to thrust for cruising flight. During VTOL, front fan output enters a boost compressor. It produces the compressed air for a combustion chamber which feeds a large lift-fan turbine. That is the implementation of lift-fan mode. The boost compressor has more stages than the front fan and is a big added load. The gas turbine engine is supercharged to turn that added load: Part of the boost compressor output is taken during VTOL. This is a new version of the supercharging. During cruise flight, a low pressure turbine stage is bypassed to match the lesser load. That completes the apparatus for a variable-cycle VTOL engine.","Kosheleff, Patrick A.

The semiconductor switching device is periodically activated by a trigger circuit to initiate discharge of energy stored in exciter tank capacitor to mating ignition lead and igniter plug. The circuit operates at a modest, for example, approximately 1.8 kV, tank circuit voltage to further reduce switching device leakage current related stresses at elevated temperatures allowing relatively long capacitor charge cycles, increased upper operating temperature capability and improved reliability. The circuit uses a low side switch circuit topology for releasing energy from said capacitor to ground whereby negative polarity energy is applied to the exciter.","Wilmot, Theodore S.

8382030,US,02/26/2013,Variable cycle VTOL powerplant,"A VTOL aircraft powerplant choosing between a low-power, turbofan mode during cruise flight and a high-power, lift fan mode during vertical flight. Turbofan mode is a gas turbine engine's shaft power driving a remote front fan. Its fan flow goes to thrust for cruising flight. During VTOL, front fan output enters a boost compressor. It produces the compressed air for a combustion chamber which feeds a large lift-fan turbine. That is the implementation of lift-fan mode. The boost compressor has more stages than the front fan and is a big added load. The gas turbine engine is supercharged to turn that added load: Part of the boost compressor output is taken during VTOL. This is a new version of the supercharging. During cruise flight, a low pressure turbine stage is bypassed to match the lesser load. That completes the apparatus for a variable-cycle VTOL engine.","Kosheleff, Patrick A.

7618606,US,11/17/2009,Separation of carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas mixtures,"A reaction-based process has been developed for the selective removal of carbon dioxide from a multicomponent gas mixture. The proposed process effects the separation of CO2 from a mixture of gases by its reaction with metal oxides. The Calcium based Reaction Separation for CO2 process consists of contacting a CO2 laden gas with calcium oxide in a reactor such that CaO captures the CO2 by the formation of calcium carbonate. Once “spent”, CaCO3 is regenerated by its calcination leading to the formation of fresh CaO sorbent. The “regenerated” CaO is then recycled for the further capture of more CO2. This process also identifies the application of a mesoporous CaCO3 structure, that attains >90% conversion over multiple carbonation and calcination cycles. Lastly, thermal regeneration (calcination) under vacuum provided a better sorbent structure that maintained reproducible reactivity levels over multiple cycles.","Fan, Liang-shih (Columbus, OH, US)

In this invention gas compression takes place by using pinwheel-like thrusters to induce a very high velocity full forced vortex in the gas being compressed. Much higher “tip” velocities can be achieved because no strength-limited solid centrifugal impeller is required to spin up the gas. Due to the consequent very high vortex velocity a single stage pressure ratio of twenty five to one, or more, may be possible. Because there is no high pressure turbine, the gas pressure delivered to some downstream useful work device is much higher than is the case with conventional gas turbine engines. The invention's compressor requires no major moving parts except for the gas flow. The consequence is that the invention is predicted to have substantially better performance and general characteristics than conventional gas turbine engines.","Richards Jr., Chester L.

The manufacture of the materials relies on the control of deposition temperature and in-vacuum consolidation during vapor deposition, on maximized heat transfer or casting pressure during all-liquid processing and on controlled friction and shock power during solid state alloying using a mechanical milling technique. The alloy synthesis is followed by extrusion, rolling, forging, drawing and superplastic forming for which the conditions of mechanical working, thermal exposure and time to transfer corresponding metastable α′-matrix phases and microstructure into product form depend on thermal stability and transformation behavior at higher temperatures of said light alloy as well as on the defects inherent to a specific alloy synthesis employed.

Then a value is determined for either of the hole exit area or the hole inlet area, and the other area is calculated from the known ratio. Once the hole angle, hole exit area and hole inlet area have been determined, then a swirler can be cast with as-cast holes using these hole parameters.","Farmer, Gilbert (Cincinnati, OH)
